-speak Matt 
Hello, and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role!
Unfortunately we're down a Travis Willingham tonight.
A quick recap: the party has allied with a mindflayer named Clarota.
Who has been ostracised, and wishes to save its people from the mysterious being called K'varn.
You guys managed to find the halfling paladin, Lady Kima, in a torture chamber beneath Emberhold.
Save her, slay her oppressor, and make a tenuous alliance.
As Lady Kima and Clarota are very much at odds.
And last we left off, you were on the main floor of Emberhold.
-speak Sam 
We are inside this fortress.
-speak Matt 
Correct.
-speak Sam 
We're trying to find the armory or something, is that right?
-speak Matt 
Lady Kima has mentioned she wants to find the rest of her equipment.
That she says is either in an armory, or she mentioned a vault.
She also mentioned something about vengeance to those who run the keep.
So she stormed up.
-speak Laura 
We're following her, right?
-speak Matt 
You've followed her back up to the base floor of the Emberhold itself.
-speak Laura 
And she said she would lead the way to the vault?
-speak Sam 
Do we hear any footsteps around us or guards marching around?
Are we in immediate peril or do we have a second?
-speak Matt 
Make a perception roll.
-speak Laura 
22!
-speak Liam 
28.
-speak Matt 
You can hear echoes of distant footsteps, far out of sight.
You hear some other movement on the floor above you.
You wait, and the entire place settles into eerie silence.
-speak Vax 
They know we're here, still.
-speak Vex 
But they don't know where we are.
-speak Percy 
Lady Kima, do you remember where the vault is?
Do you remember how we can get back there?
-speak Kima  
I only saw half of this stronghold before they captured me.
Probably somewhere on the second floor.
-speak Vax 
There were stairs going up in that first room.
-speak Vex 
Oh, right!
So we could go back in the little storage room.
-speak Vax 
We should just spend the next three hours in the storage room.
-speak Vex 
Let's go in the storage room and go up.
-speak Vax 
Lady Kima, allow me to take a peek around the corner, see what's going on.
-speak Liam 
So I'm gonna go stealth. 29.
-speak Matt 
She begrudgingly steps back.
She had that eagerness to get in some sort of a fray, to bash someone with this greatsword that you gave her.
-movetoken vax 0 -2

She lets you pass.
You creep up along the edge.

You see two hallways continuing upward, and off to the left a large doorway guarded by two duergar.
-speak Percy 
Take the empty hallway?
-speak Scanlan 
Why don't we just kill them?
-speak Laura 
How dark is it in here?
-speak Matt 
Pretty dark.
You can see 60 feet with darkvision, so anything past the duergar you can't make out.
There are a few of those red crystals that give off a little bit of light. 
Duergar like it very, very dark.
The crystals are more of a courtesy to guests.
-speak Vex 
So potentially, brother, we could take them both out if you throw your knife and I do an arrow.
-setbattle CR_C1_E7/3 30 40
-updatebattle
-speak Matt 
The door here is also a little ajar- the inside looks to be a storage room.
There's just a series of boxes and barrels.
-speak Vex 
Maybe you can put yourself in a box and walk around.
-speak Marisha 
Yes! Metal Gear Solid it!
-speak Liam 
I continue to creep away from my sister, specifically.

-speak Sam 
Wait, what about us!?
-speak Laura 
Why are you doing this?
-speak Scanlan 
Jesus. Two duergar, we can take them out in a second!
-speak Matt 
You see an opening to this room. No door, just an archway.
-speak Vex 
Everybody wait while my brother goes on a field trip!

-speak Liam 
All right, so I'm going to press against the wall, see if I can hear anything.
-speak Matt 
Perception check.
-speak Liam

-speak Matt 
You hear what sounds like a light crackling of some sort of a fire?
And the occasional dull ring of metal being hit against metal.
-speak Liam 
Okay, I'm going to get low to the ground, and peek in the door.

-updatebattle
-speak Matt 
Peeking through, you do see, indeed, it is some sort of a smithy.
A forge, a work table in the center.
There is one lone duergar in the middle of his work.
Hasn't been paying attention to any of the ruckus going on around.
He's in the middle of hitting some sort of long, thick piece of black iron.
Sweat dripping down the front of his brow, the room itself is a lot warmer than the rest of the fortress.
-speak Liam 
I see the door on the other side, so I take the earring–
-speak Sam 
Oh, why don't you just keep going forever?
-speak Liam 
I whisper to my sister:
-speak Vax 
Follow along.
-speak Vex 
Oh. I've been invited on the field trip, guys!
-speak Scanlan 
Just you?
-speak Vex 
Just me!
-speak Scanlan 
Come on!
-speak Laura 
I should not go with you, I can't stealth for shit right now.
I rolled a 7.
-speak Vax 
Send Scanlan up.
-speak Vex 
Scanlan.
-speak Scanlan 
Huh, what?
-speak Vex 
My brother's calling for you.
-speak Matt 
You feel the oppressive force of Clarota's voice in your head say:
-speak Clarota  
I can also accompany.

She looks back at Grog, whose hands are also wringing his greataxe.

Man, you can't control Kima!
-speak Marisha 
This is why we don't have AI in the party, guys.
You can't control the AI.

Trinket, who hasn't seen you in a while, is sticking to your back.
-speak Laura 
I sit there and I pet him as I look around the corner.
-speak Matt 
Trinket is enjoying the petting.
With that duergar down, the armory is open and at your disposal.
There are a partially made weapons scattered in a pile.
There are some ingots, some raw iron materials.
-speak Scanlan 
Kima, do you see any of your equipment here that you wanted?
-speak Matt 
She glances around, goes through some of the piles.
As quietly as she can. Not as quietly as you'd like, but quiet enough.
-speak Kima 
No. Nothing's here.
-speak Scanlan 
Can't you just take one of these things and call it a day?
-speak Matt 
She glares in the direction of your voice.
-speak Kima 
Let's keep looking.

All right, I'm following after her, tiptoeing after her.
-speak Laura 
We should go after her. Because we're gonna get split up.
Let's all go in that back way and see if we can stealth around.
-speak Matt 
For everyone else, stealth check.

It appears to be some sort of a guest bedroom.

Vex?
-speak Laura 
Can I see anything?
-speak Matt 
Not really.
It's kinda dark. You can make out some movement in the distance.
-speak Laura 
Can I hop on Trinket's back and see if I can see higher?
-speak Matt 
You can try.
So you hop on the back of Trinket.
Grog is blocking part of your view, but you can make out the two duergar.
They have three-quarters cover.

-speak Laura 
Two arrows, 21 and 23.
-speak Matt 
One misses, the other hits.
Because they have cover, their AC is higher.
-speak Laura 
I Hunter's Mark him, so 13 damage.
-scene advance
-speak Matt 
All right, gotcha.
So one arrow sinks in the shoulder, but he doesn't appear to be stopping his angry advance.

As they do, they grow in size, reaching more than 6 feet tall.

He'd probably agree with you, what do you wanna do?

Thanks, Grog!
Can we arrange like a fastball special, almost?
-speak Matt 
How are you going to communicate this to Grog?
-narrate 
Liam meows.
-continue 
I'm gonna have to say, unfortunately, that's not gonna work out for this moment.
Grog's attention is on the duergar and you are a giant cat.
You can attempt to leap over him?
-speak Marisha 
Can I vault off his back?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.
-speak Marisha 
11?
-speak Matt 
So you jump off of Grog's back.

You push off of him at an awkward angle, landing weirdly.

I'm gonna go ahead and do my bite attack.

-speak Matt 
You rush forward, biting at him.
He pulls back, but you get a big, meaty chunk of his forearm and clamp down.
You feel a snap, some bone in the middle of his arm.
He yells in pain, clipping you with a first to get you to let go.
Leaving that nasty taste of duergar blood, that you've now become accustomed to.
Back to Vax.

The door is a secondary guest room.
-speak Liam 
And now, poop on this bed.
-speak Matt 
It is a guest room of equal design and dressing as the one that Scanlan, you are unaware, is currently fouling.
-speak Ashley 
Maybe I get a sudden urge for some reason to just poo on the bed.
-speak Matt 
You can do what you want.
Be aware, Pike as a character has her intent.
The more you stray from that, the more it will have ramifications for her in the end.
-speak Ashley 
Yes, I know, I'm just kidding, 
That's not what I want to do.
-speak Sam 
She could probably hear me grunting. Through the wall.
-speak Matt 
That's about as far as you're able to move.
You can still use your action if you wanted to do anything, but right now your vision is currently blocked.
-speak Ashley 
Yeah, okay, so I'll just hang out there.

My invisible pantaloons.
Did I find anything in there, by the way?
-speak Liam 
Just relief.
-speak Matt 
You found a fun way to prank duergar.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, yeah, did I find anything in the barracks?
-speak Matt 
Over there? No.
-speak Taliesin 
Did Vax find anything shiny in the room?
The shiny thing.

No, I got interrupted.
That's a good idea, thanks for the reminder, Percy.

It then vanishes.
And the doors that you guys entered slam behind you.

As you can see this divine energy begin to burst and glow off the edge of the greatsword that she's holding.
She leaps, and cuts through the air with a giant arc.
Lighting that portion of the room.
The blade comes down, and hits.
Second attack also hits.
