-speak Ashley 
Yes, go Kima.
-speak Matt 
So that comes to– okay, using her Divine Smite ability on top of that, she manages to deal 37 points of damage to it.
-speak Taliesin 
Damn.
-speak Matt 
As she finishes both of her strikes simultaneously.
The mindflayer, however, does not release its grasp on you.
You are still considered grappled.
That ends her turn.
Grog now is gonna angrily attempt to bash into this door, is gonna make an– actually no, no athletics check, he's going to go into a rage and hitting away at the door.
(growling)

LIAM and LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
All right, that puts a total of 32 points of damage, that's enough.
So Grog just takes two big swings.
The first one comes through, cracks the door in half, splitting it down the center.
Rears back a second time, cleaves through the door entirely.
What little bit is left on the hinges, he kicks out with his foot, leaving now this side completely open to the interior.
He then moves in around Clarota.
That's as far as he can get in this current turn.
That brings us to Vax.
-speak Liam 
What can I do while grappled, nothing until I'm ungrappled?
-speak Matt 
Well, no, you can try and make an acrobatics or athletics roll against them to try and break free.
-speak Liam 
Okay, but then do I have an action once that's done or that's the action?
-speak Matt 
I'll let you use that as your move.
-speak Liam 
All right, so I'm gonna try to use, I guess athletics is what I would do.
-speak Matt 
Or acrobatics, up to you, whichever's higher.
-speak Liam 
Well, that would be acrobatics.
-speak Matt 
Acrobatics, then.
-speak Liam 
27.
-speak Matt 
27?
-speak Liam 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
That'll do it.
-speak Liam 
Okay.
-speak Matt 
You manage to, just in that moment of it being struck with the two blade strikes from Lady Kima, you manage to pull your head free from its grasp.
And just manage to right yourself now, the throbbing pain in your head of what you just narrowly avoided still there.
-speak Liam 
Okay.
Poison dagger in hand, I roll an 18.
Does that hit?
-speak Matt 
Okay.
18.
Currently that does hit, yes.
-speak Liam 
I wanna grab him by the calamari and stab him in the eye.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Okay, go for it.
-speak Liam 
That's what I did, so– and then if I'm five feet– if Kima's there, I can sneak attack according to the rules?
-speak Matt 
Correct.
-speak Liam 
All right, so I'm gonna stab him in the eye.
One.
Plus the sneak attack damage is two, four,
ten, 13, 19, 38, plus seven– 45.
-speak Matt 
45.
All right.
So, as you–
-speak Liam 
With the poison dagger.
-speak Matt 
Right, the poison dagger.
I think you've already used the daily poison ability on this.
-speak Liam 
I don't remember, so it's just a stab.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
So the 45 points of damage.
You pull back and you jam it into the side of its eye.
You can see as it rears back, a spray of dark-colored liquid kind of warms the side of your face.
As you pull the blade back out it rears back and (growls).
You can hear its voice piercing into your head going, 
-speak Matt 
I will eat you one way or another!
-speak Ashley 
No, you won't!
-speak Laura 
Did it distract him enough that we lost our thingy?
-speak Matt 
That's your main attack?
-speak Liam 
I mean, I would imagine between ungrappling and stabbing, is that it for me?
Or do I get my second attack, I don't know?
-speak Matt 
You can get your second attack, I'm sorry.
-speak Liam 
Okay, well I think, go fuck yourself, and stab again.
Nine plus– 19.
-speak Matt 
19?
Yeah, that hits.
-speak Liam 
Other eye, other eye.
No sneak attack.
Two plus– eight.
-speak Matt 
Eight.
Okay.
As it rears back and you hear it saying that, you pull back and you grab with your off hand the cluster of tentacles in the front of its face and pull it down.
As you do, the inertia– you jam the blade into the other eye.
As you do, you hear this blast burst of angry scream inside your head, before it goes dead cold, silent, and the mind flayer falls to the ground.
-speak Liam 
I fucking hate these things!
-speak Matt 
All right.
That brings us to Clarota, who's currently stunned and fails save, Clarota's still stunned.
Tiberius.
-speak Orion 
I look through the door.
-speak Matt 
Look through the door.
-speak Orion 
What's going on in here?
Are there any enemies I can see?
-speak Matt 
You can see over here, barely.
It's very dark in the far corner, you can see just the shape of some humanoid there.
-speak Orion 
Oh.
Okay, is he– (laughs)
-speak Matt 
What are you doing, Tiberius?
-speak Orion 
(laughs) How tall is the thing?
-speak Matt 
From what you can see, it's maybe roughly six, seven feet.
Grog's blocking most of it.
-speak Orion 
No, like, we're in a bunker, right?
-speak Matt 
Right now, you're in this giant great hall with giant tables and stools everywhere.
-speak Orion 
And the ceiling is–
-speak Matt 
You can't see the ceiling right now, there's no light.
-speak Orion 
Oh.
-speak Matt 
The room is near pitch-black, like there's just very little light in there currently.
-speak Orion 
I will waltz in behind Grog.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Orion 
I cast Light.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
The room all of a sudden bursts into view, you can now see the walls, the ceiling– it's a smooth stone room.
There is a large chandelier currently hanging from the top of the ceiling.
It's about 25 feet up to the ceiling in this current room.
-speak Marisha 
(gasps) There's a big chandelier.
That's fun.
-speak Orion 
And now do I see that guy better?
-speak Matt 
You do, yes.
You see now there is a mind flayer currently ducking behind one of the tables right now.
You can see a number of your friends in the party are currently clutching their heads, silently screaming to themselves, unmoving.
-speak Orion 
Ah, right.
There's another one of those guys over there!
-speak Marisha 
Wait, there's another one?
-speak Orion 
Yes!
-speak Marisha 
There's two?
-speak Matt 
There's two.
-speak Orion 
I spend three sorcerer points.
-speak Matt 
How many sorcerer points do you have left?
You spent a lot over the past couple games.
-speak Orion 
No, I have not, because I didn't do anything last game, because I was all recharged.
-speak Matt 
That's true, actually.
Okay.
Just keep track of that.
So how many do you have left?
-speak Orion 
I have eight right now.
Now I'll spend it to go down to–
-speak Laura 
Five.
-speak Orion 
Five.
'Cause math.
-speak Matt 
Okay, got you.
Cool, good on you.
-speak Marisha 
Fantasy math.
Once again, 826LA, after-school tutoring.
Good charity.
-speak Orion 
I could have used it.
I cast my pillars, or Grand Columns, as I like to call it, and (piston sound) all the way up and smash that little bastard.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Marisha 
Smashy smashy.
-speak Matt 
So what's the save you get past that for the spell?
-speak Orion 
He does a dex save, and he takes 6d6 damage, and the dex save is to see if he's pinned or not.
-speak Matt 
Right.
It does make its save, I believe, it's 21?
-speak Orion 
Oh, my, what?
-speak Matt 
Rolled a 21 versus your DC of your spell, which I believe is not higher than 21.
-speak Orion 
No.
-speak Matt 
So yeah, so he still takes the damage, but is not pinned.
-speak Orion 
Which is 15, 18 points of damage.
-speak Matt 
Okay, 18 points of damage, and manages to pull out of the way just in time as it slams into him, he darts off and catches himself on the ground, kind of slowly levitating above the ground as he comes to a stop.
The pillar then slams into the roof, this section here.
Actually splinters part of the table, which is now kind of lifted off-kilter at an angle.
Yup.
It–
-speak Orion 
Oh, so that– does that mean he's in the air for a whole round?
'Cause how it works is, he's all the way up to that height, but he gets to come, or fall, back down if he makes the save.
That's how– so he has to travel that distance, so does he cast Levitate as he's coming down?
-speak Matt 
How I'm playing it is, the impact of the pillar suddenly slamming in from underneath is what does the initial damage, and he manages to roll off before it slams into the ceiling.
He kinda– So.
However, that ends your turn.
The mind flayer, now looking around and seeing the room lit up, seeing the entire group now in this room, looks around at everyone, puts its hands together and concentrates– and as it does you see its form (sucking noise) vanish.
-speak Marisha 
Damn it!
-speak Matt 
A few seconds pass, you guys manage to shrug your stun, and Clarota as well.
-speak Ashley 
Whoa, what happened?
-speak Marisha 
That's not good.
-speak Laura 
What happened?
-speak Marisha 
They really know we're here.
-speak Laura 
We need to get out of this room, then.
-speak Taliesin 
Let's just search the rest of this floor as quickly as possible.
-speak Marisha 
As quickly as possible.
-speak Laura 
Grog, can you always put down the dust of tracelessness?
-speak Matt 
All right, I will.
-speak Marisha 
I'm going to go ahead and dart down this hall that we know is for sure empty.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Liam 
Exit the other side of the great hall that we're in.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Laura 
And I think we should all go back– we should go to the second floor.
-speak Matt 
Through here.
-speak Liam 
Walking in that door.
-speak Matt 
You look through here and see what appears to be some sort of a kitchen.
You can see shelf units, you can see what looks like a few tables, you can see some kitchen elements.
-speak Liam 
I'm gonna walk all the way in, all the way in.
-speak Matt 
All right, you walk all the way in.
There's a door towards the back–
-speak Liam 
The right, what do I see?
-speak Matt 
The right, you see what looks to be a doorway that's partially open that leads to a staircase.
-speak Liam 
Up or down?
-speak Matt 
Looks like it's going up.
-speak Marisha 
And what's in this room?
I'm looking over here.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you look over here.
It's a double door that is currently closed.
-speak Taliesin 
I will head in your direction as well.
-speak Orion 
Eight, two of my d6s to heal up.
-speak Matt 
You haven't taken a short rest yet.
You have to– you guys have to stop and take ten minutes, 15 minutes to rest to do that, so–
-speak Sam 
I'm gonna look all over the great hall and see if there's any cool stuff in there.
-speak Matt 
Make a perception check.
-speak Laura 
I think what we should do– Everyone, I think what we should do is make our way back to the initial storage room we were in and go up that stairway, because that one's hidden.
It's by a hidden entrance, people aren't gonna think about that one as much as main stairways.
-speak Taliesin 
I agree, I think we should– I agree with that, I just think we should check the rest of the floor as well.
Just double-check everything, make sure we didn't miss the–
-speak Liam 
Vax is heading back to the group.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Marisha 
Percy and I are checking this room with the double doors.
Do you have any trap checks to see if it's locked?
-speak Liam 
I do!
-speak Matt 
Okay, so Percy and both you guys open this doorway.
It opens up into what looks to be another smaller eating hall.
This one's nicer, this one has one long table.
This is probably where the more socially risen–
-speak Taliesin 
Take a quick look around.
-speak Marisha 
Yeah, anything in there?
-speak Matt 
Looks like it hasn't been used for a day or two.
-speak Taliesin 
All right.
-speak Marisha 
No cool goodies?
-speak Matt 
No current goodies in this area, no.
-speak Taliesin 
So we'll go– just keep going down and check the rest of that hallway.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Laura 
There's a lot more, you guys.
I think we should go find the vault on the second floor.
-speak Matt 
All right, you guys press down here.
There apparently are now– you can see there's another set of double doors–
-speak Liam 
Vax is following.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Laura 
I think I should gather the group and try to make it back to the other storage room.
Just to get us out of this area specifically.
-speak Matt 
So you guys are all moving back with–
-speak Laura 
Is that cool?
-speak Matt 
– Vex to return to the previous storage room?
-speak Marisha 
We can do that.
Yeah, go for it.
-speak Taliesin 
And you'll hear us if anything goes wrong.
Yeah, we'll power through it.
-speak Laura 
Use your earring.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Marisha 
I'll go ahead and very– I'm just gonna kinda use my keen sense– or sorry, my keen smell again to see if I can smell any duergar in the area.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
Go ahead and make a perception check with advantage.
-speak Marisha 
That's pretty good.
Oh yeah, I'll take that first roll, which was seven– 27.
-speak Matt 
27.
You smell that on this floor, there doesn't appear to be any duergar in your immediate vicinity.
There is a strong, lingering scent of them coming from the doorway that you're currently at.
-speak Marisha 
A strong, lingering scent?
-speak Matt 
Correct, like it– you can kind of tell there was a recent moving of a large number of duergar.
-speak Marisha 
But probably not present.
-speak Matt 
You don't know.
-speak Marisha 
Whatever.
I guess we'll see what's in here.
-speak Matt 
All righty.
-speak Marisha 
Peeky, peeky.
-speak Liam 
I kind of parkour past Percy.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Orion 
Parkour past Percy!
-speak Marisha 
Parkour, parkour!
-speak Matt 
You open the doors into what appears to be a large temple chamber, a place of worship.
What you see are a series of long, wooden benches that are arranged to look towards the center.
There is an altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone dais, and in the center there is a stone table, an altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped over it and something on top of it you can't see from this distance.
In the center of the room there is a 12-foot-tall statue of what looks like an extremely strong armored duergar clutching a giant warhammer and a shield.
-speak Marisha 
Hm.
I'm gonna– oh wait, I'm a tiger.
-speak Matt 
Yup.
-speak Liam 
I'm gonna perception check the room.
Which is high.
27.
-speak Matt 
27?
There does not appear to be anybody inside this room.
-speak Liam 
Screw this room.
-speak Matt 
However, do you have a religion–
-speak Taliesin 
I would like to do a religion roll.
-speak Matt 
Roll religion, guys.
-speak Taliesin 
Nine.
-speak Liam 
Nine.
-speak Ashley 
Could I do a religion roll from where I am?
-speak Matt 
You are not over there, unfortunately.
-speak Marisha 
That's what I was gonna do, is tell somebody to get Pike over here real quick.
-speak Laura 
Do you guys have earrings?
-speak Ashley 
I can put on my sprinter's boots.
-speak Liam 
Yeah, Pike, Pike?
There's some sort of religious artifacts over here.
Could use your expertise.
-speak Matt 
Pike, you make your way through, eventually coming down this hallway–
(clanking)

-speak Marisha 
She's coming!
I can hear her coming.
-speak Ashley 
Hey guys, I'm here!
Did you know I was coming?
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a religion check.
-speak Liam 
Don't stab anything.
-speak Orion 
I'm gonna follow suit, but slowly.
-speak Ashley 
17.
-speak Matt 
All right.
As you're heading that direction slowly, best that you can tell right now, this room is definitely a small temple built to– and the name kind of escapes you, the words trying to form in your head for a second, and then eventually you come to realize this is a chapel to Laduguer.
Laduguer is the deity of the duergar.
It's the god that basically freed them from their original enslavement from the illithids, and they worship as a pinnacle of power, strength, and conquest.
-speak Orion 
I make it up to where those guys are.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Taliesin 
Let's keep searching.
-speak Sam 
Hey, what's the darkness right next to me?
Is there a door there?
What is that?
-speak Matt 
There is a door right over here.
-speak Sam 
Oh.
I'm gonna open it.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
All right.
So you go ahead and open the door.
It opens up into what you can immediately see is a chamber that is some kind of magical laboratory.
You see in the far corner, hunched, a robed duergar, and as you open the door, there's a slight sound, a click sound, and a jet of greenish fume begins to spray up into your face.
Make a constitution save.
-speak Sam 
Oh, god.
I don't even know what that is!
(laughs) 15.
-speak Matt 
15?
All right.
So you take 11 points of poison damage.
However, you can feel the poison forcing its way into your lungs.
You manage to back out of the cloud in time and cough it up and your general physical well-being– you resist most of the effects of the poison.
However, this poison fume trap did appear to go off and as the smoke slowly dissipates, you hear a chuckle across the other side.
-speak Orion 
As I hear the noise, I–
-speak Matt 
You don't hear the noise, you're too far away.
-speak Orion 
Oh, shit.
-speak Matt 
You guys do hear it, though.
-speak Laura 
Okay, I come over there and see what the– what just happened.
-speak Matt 
Okay, as you rush over, Scanlan's backed up away and you can see there's this chamber here.
-speak Laura 
Is the poison still in the air, or is it–
-speak Matt 
It's dissipated at this point.
It's thin enough.
You still can smell it, and it smells awful, like a very, very heavy, electrical fire-type smell.
-speak Laura 
So I can see that guy?
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
-speak Laura 
So should I notch an arrow and try to hit him?
-speak Matt 
It's up to you.
What're you going to do?
-speak Laura 
All right, I attack him, then!
-speak Matt 
All right, go for it then.
-speak Ashley 
Attack him!
Get him!
-speak Laura 
Shabang!
Oh, dang it, I didn't do it.
I meant to Hunter's Mark him and transfer it over, but that's okay, I didn't say it.
-speak Matt 
You didn't say it this time.
-speak Laura 
That's 30.
For the first.
-speak Liam 
You did say shabang.
-speak Laura 
I did say shabang, and 16 for the second.
-speak Matt 
Okay, both hit.
Go ahead and roll damage on each.
-speak Ashley 
Hit it.
(music flares up)

-speak Laura 
Well, sort of.
15 and eight.
-speak Matt 
15 and eight.
All right.
-speak Liam 
The music is on.
-speak Matt 
All right.
So both arrows you've been firing over the top.
He's kind of hard to see with the table and from being crouched in the corner, but both arrows still manage to barely make their mark.
One kind of pins him against the wall, and he looks at his shoulder briefly, looks back at you, raises his hand, as he begins muttering something under his breath.
As he does, your arrow (shnk) through his hand and he tries to shake it, and now he's pinned to the wall with an arrow in the middle of his hand.
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah!
-speak Laura 
Trinket!
Oh no, I used two attacks.
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
-speak Laura 
Dang it.
-speak Matt 
You can still tell Trinket to move.
What are you gonna do?
-speak Laura 
No, no no, I'm gonna hold him there, 'cause he's already in the room.
-speak Matt 
Okay, got you.
All right, so what are you guys doing over in the temple?
-speak Liam 
Exiting.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Marisha 
No!
Look and see if there's anything cool, first.
What was that thing that's covered up by the blanket on the altar?
-speak Matt 
You keep walking towards it?
-speak Marisha 
Yeah.
What's up with that?
-speak Matt 
You make your way, you look at the top of the dais where the altar is, and on top you can see the black cloth that is wrapped over it.
The scent gets to you before the actual visual.
It's freshly rotting flesh of some kind, and as you glance over, you can see there is a heart that has been cut from a body and it's at the point where the blood has coagulated and begin to become thick.
It's roughly dwarven size.
-speak Marisha 
I get up and I grab it in my mouth.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
It tastes disgusting.
-speak Marisha 
And then I walk over to Vax and I lay it at his feet.
I kind of nudge it with my nose.
-speak Matt 
She got you a heart.
-speak Liam 
I scritch Keyleth behind the ear, but nudge it aside with my toe and exit the room.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Liam 
I did scritch her ears, but I'm going to continue down to the end of the hall.
-speak Matt 
This way?
-speak Liam 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you make your way into what looks like a giant foyer, into a secondary entrance in the side of the fortress.
-speak Liam 
I just walk all the way over to the corner, stealthing.
-speak Matt 
Make a stealth check.
-speak Liam 
It's high, it's 28.
-speak Matt 
28, got it, okay.
So, as you make your way through, you eventually careen to this corner.
You can see another hallway, what appears to be another room of some kind.
You also glance back and see there are two sets of stairways that go up and down.
-speak Liam 
What's behind me?
-speak Matt 
This is a giant foyer that leads outside of the fortress.
-speak Liam 
And the edge of the map this way?
-speak Matt 
This way here?
This way?
This comes to an abrupt end at that point, a rocky wall into the mountain itself that it's buttressed up against.
-speak Liam 
Okay, I'm gonna keep coming this way, stealthing.
-speak Matt 
All right.
As you move through–
-speak Laura 
What's happening with that dude I– are you doing all this while I just pin down–
-speak Liam 
Yeah.
I don't know what's going on back there.
I'm just walking around.
-speak Matt 
So, you glance in this room.
There's an open walkway and what appears to be another barrack section, also completely empty.
-speak Liam 
Screw that.
Do I see a door for this room that's still darkened out?
Then I'm gonna keep sliding along the wall.
-speak Matt 
Okay, as you slide along here, to make your way around to a door there.
-speak Liam 
Okay.
Pressing my hand, just to see if I can check any for traps.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Liam 
26.
-speak Matt 
26, all right.
The door does not appear to be trapped.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm gonna be heading in that direction anyway.
-speak Marisha 
Agreed.
Same here.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Liam 
I would like to stealth through the door.
-speak Orion 
Before I leave, I carefully examine that statue.
-speak Matt 
Okay, what are you examining?
-speak Orion 
The facial features of the god, the deity, right?
Is that what he is?
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
Okay, so you look at the face of Laduguer.
You can see it's very, very old, it's very well-crafted.
You can see a lot of very meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation.
It almost glistens with a perfection that is out of place in an area that is so covered in soot and various other volcanic activity-based mineral deposits.
-speak Orion 
I'm gonna do a quick arcana check, just to see if there's any kind of mystical thing around it or anything like that.
And it's 19.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
There is some sort of a hum to the air that has an arcane element to it, but you are unable to pinpoint what it necessarily means or what the source is.
-speak Orion 
Interesting.
Knowing that, I kind of gather my thoughts and I head towards where the rest of the group is.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so, while you're opening the door, the mage in the far corner kind of looks about sporadically and looks down at the arrow in its hand and its shoulder and just kind of fearfully, 
-speak Matt 
Wait wait wait!
Wait.
Stop.
Don't attack.
Let's have a conversation.
-speak Laura 
Speak fast.
Before I kill you.
-speak Matt 
He leans forward, kind of pulling the arrow out of the doorway.
(groans in pain) Starts hobbling towards you a little bit.
-speak Laura 
Can we all– we go in the room and Trinket goes up next to him and, like, gets all up in his face?
-speak Matt 
Okay.
As you both enter, both of you make constitution saving throws.
As two more plumes of poison (pff) out of the ground as both you and Trinket walk in.
-speak Liam 
Good.
-speak Laura 
15?
-speak Matt 
15, okay.
And for Trinket as well.
-speak Laura 
Oh, I should've been so smart, but I wasn't.
(laughter)

-speak Laura 
14 for Trinket.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
You take seven points of poison damage.
-speak Laura 
Okay.
-speak Matt 
Trinket, however, takes 14 points of poison damage.
-speak Laura 
Oh man.
What did I get, seven?
-speak Matt 
Seven.
And Trinket is currently considered poisoned.
-speak Laura 
Oh no!
-speak Sam 
What does that mean?
-speak Matt 
It means disadvantage on attack rolls, disadvantage on ability checks.
-speak Laura 
That's okay.
-speak Matt 
And now there's a bear coughing and kind of thrashing about the room.
The table it bumps into and it kind of topples over.
-speak Laura 
Is this like a turn thing or can I do something?
-speak Matt 
Well, this is just a reactionary moment of you guys coughing and trying to get out of this poisonous fume.
-speak Laura 
I mean, can I quickly cast Protection from Poison on Trinket?
-speak Matt 
You can, yes.
-speak Laura 
Okay.
I do that.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Laura 
And that cures it.
-speak Matt 
That completely removes the poison?
-speak Laura 
Yes it does.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Laura 
Yay Trinket!
-speak Matt 
Well done.
So that's your action.
You now, as you are checking the door and you open it up, you hear all this commotion going off to the side now.
Scanlan, you're over there as well, watching as more plumes of these poisonous smoke bits.
-speak Sam 
If I get close to the door without going through it, can I see the guy?
-speak Matt 
You can move over and look, you can just barely make out his form.
It is a dark room that is currently filled with a slowly dissipating green cloud so it's hard to make him out.
-speak Sam 
Okay, well then I will just– fuck (laughs).
Well, if I can't see him then I will just yell at him.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Sam 
I'll yell with Vicious Mockery.
I don't like you very much for poisoning me and my friends, you're a poopy head!
(laughter)

-speak Marisha 
So vicious.
-speak Laura 
That is threatening.
-speak Marisha 
Damn.
-speak Sam 
Ooh.
That does seven points of damage.
-speak Matt 
Seven points from Vicious Mockery?
All right!
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
I don't know how that works.
-speak Sam 
It's Vicious Mockery.
It's an attack.
-speak Matt 
That's crazy.
-speak Liam 
That's, like, 80 points of damage!
-speak Marisha 
And who said that words couldn't hurt people?
-speak Taliesin 
And bonus damage to his mother, wherever she may be.
-speak Marisha 
Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can hurt.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
So it has to make a will saving throw, against your DC.
It rolls a three.
It does not.
So, as you shout out into this room, the currently fearful duergar mage kind of glances, eyes slide about, hears these words and you see him wrack his head for a second with a sudden sense of self-loathing and disappointment.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
His hands drop and it looks like for a minute his intent to begin muttering some sort of incantation is momentarily distracted.
-speak Orion 
Nice!
-speak Matt 
All right, awesome.
-speak Ashley 
Can I start moving back?
-speak Matt 
Yeah, you can start moving back this way.
-speak Liam 
I hear that, but I'm still going to poke my head stealthily through the door and see what I see.
Do I need a new stealth check or?
-speak Matt 
Yes you do.
-speak Liam 
Okay, great.
So that is a 32.
-speak Matt 
All right, you glance inside at what looks to be some sort of a training room.
There are– most of the floor itself is stone, and in the far corner there is a large section that is mainly just sand and dirt and there are a number of wooden training structures.
You know, various shields and wooden bars that are used as a means of training for weaponry.
There's what looks like a giant rack of weapons, full of arms and stuff.
-speak Liam 
Anything good-looking?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a perception check.
-speak Liam 
One.
-speak Matt 
Most of the materials in this room look like the basic duergar fare.
-speak Liam 
These don't look very good.
-speak Taliesin 
I was going to run in and take a look around anyway so–
-speak Matt 
(laughs) Okay.
As you run in, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
-speak Taliesin 
God damn it.
Okay.
-speak Sam 
(sings) Traps, traps, traps-traps-traps.
-speak Taliesin 
24.
-speak Matt 
All right, so.
You take ten points of lightning damage as you feel a tile on the ground trigger and then spring up, and as it does, you hear this sudden high-pitched whine as blue energy streaks up from the floor, runs through your body.
Thankfully, you manage to dive out of the way and touch the ground to ground the energy, minimizing the damage.
But yeah, you triggered (laughs) triggered a trap plate.
You're beginning to get the sense that a lot of this tactic of this fortress now has been to lead you guys through a–
-speak Marisha 
Maze?
-speak Matt 
A maze of traps.
-speak Sam 
A labyrinth.
-speak Liam 
Before we hurt ourselves any longer, we should–
-speak Laura 
We've got to kill this guy.
Or talk to him at least.
-speak Liam 
We need to get to the main event here.
-speak Matt 
All right.
At this point, Kima is now– As Kima hears you shouting all these curses into the room, Kima pushes past you, and pushes past you.
You can see Kima coming into the room behind you guys.
Steps over the broken table, down in front of the circle, and grabs the mage by the front of his robe, pulling him into her face.
The mage at this point is still kind of reeling from the fact that you managed to strike him so deeply in the heart of his hearts.
-speak Sam 
He's just not a nice man.
-speak Matt 
However, Kima, with a look of absolute death in her face, grabs him and pulls him forward and says, 
-speak Matt 
Listen, where is the rest of your fucking army?
-speak Matt 
She's going to make an intimidation check.
-speak Taliesin 
Yeah!
Damn.
-speak Matt 
He does not succeed in resisting that.
-speak Laura 
Yes!
-speak Matt 
The duergar is pressed against the wall now, and she's slamming him against the back of a bookshelf.
-speak Matt 
Look, all right, they're waiting for you up there, all right?
You're not going to survive this.
At this point, the entire city's probably waiting for you in the outside of the fortress and those that are upstairs are well-prepared.
Okay?
Your best chance of survival is laying down your arms and surrendering.
I'm looking out for your best interests here.
-speak Liam 
Kill this asshole.
-speak Marisha 
Kill him.
-speak Matt 
Kima, who is still holding him against there, you can see her hand releases the scruff and he takes a deep breath for a second.
But before he can finish exhaling, she goes in, immediately grabbing his throat and squeezing it extremely tight.
As she does, you see his tongue, dangling out the side of his mouth (strangling noises) as she's cutting off his entire air supply.
She pulls forward and takes the greatsword and begins to slowly push it into his abdomen.
As she does, he starts screaming in terrible pain.
You can see her just slowly pushing the blade through his body into the bookcase behind.
As she does, she goes, 
-speak Matt 
You're gonna tell me, right now, who they have waiting for us upstairs.
-speak Matt 
As she begins to push all the way to the hilt now, he's pinned up against the bookcase and probably a portion of the stonework behind him.
He's now got blood pouring out the sides of his face and outside the front of his nose.
The duergar being held up against the wall says, 
-speak Matt 
Whatever you haven't killed.
The army's probably up with the king himself.
They're all waiting for you and I hope they piss on your body when they're done!
-speak Matt 
At which point she takes the blade and twists it.
As she does, he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes just go blank.
Blanker than the duergar eyes normally are.
-speak Orion 
I make it to the doorway and go, what is going on in here?
-speak Laura 
Are there any– taking that in– any healing potions or anything in here that we could use?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make an investigation check.
-speak Sam 
Can I look at the door and see if the trap will go off again if we step through it again?
-speak Matt 
Perception check.
-speak Sam 
20.
-speak Matt 
Looks like, from glancing about the room and getting a feel for it, there were three traps that were all placed directly at the front of the door, basically to give him a point of defense, they've all been trigger ed, so you don't have to worry about any more in this room.
-speak Laura 
Is this still considered the Underdark?
-speak Matt 
This is, yes.
-speak Laura 
Oh, cool!
-speak Sam 
I'm going to go in and look around some more.
-speak Matt 
You're looking around as well?
-speak Sam 
Look around for potions and stuff.
-speak Laura 
Oh, that's considered the– aw, I could have been rolling twice for all these damn things!
-speak Matt 
(sings) Remember your abilities.
-speak Laura 
(sings) 25.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Sam 
Who's the singer here, people?
-speak Matt 
Sorry, Scanlan.
So, as Kima pulls the blade from its body, kicking it off the greatsword and wiping it across the leather on the side– the leather that you gave to her!
And a little part of you is like, (sadly) hmm.
-speak Liam 
That's all right.
Worth it.
This halfling's hot.
-speak Matt 
So you guys made your way back, Clarota's there, against the corner, and Grog rushes over, just feeling like he was ready for action.
-speak Matt 
What's going on?
-speak Ashley 
You're too late.
-speak Marisha 
This might be a good time to stop for a moment.
-speak Matt 
That's up to you guys, as I say, do you guys want to take a short rest?
-speak Laura 
Did I find any potions?
Did I find anything?
-speak Matt 
Yes.
Glancing around the room, you manage to find two potions of healing, one potion of superior healing.
-speak All 
Ooh.
-speak Laura 
What is that?
That's major.
-speak Marisha 
That's cool.
-speak Matt 
You also find one vial of some sort of weird, viscous yellow liquid that you cannot identify.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, don't open that.
Who knows how long those guards had to be staked out here?
Don't open that.
-speak Sam 
Can I do a– can I investigate it or arcana it?
-speak Matt 
Sure, you can give it a go.
-speak Sam 
Yeah.
That's a one.
-speak Laura 
Oh good.
-speak Sam 
Oh wait, no, that's a seven.
These dice are horrible.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's bad.
-speak Matt 
It looks delicious.
No, actually, you can't make out, it has some changing color as you kind of swirl the bottle and watch the texture inside shift and change with the centrifugal force.
You can't make out anything about its intent, but it does feel like it's a potion created with some effect.
-speak Sam 
Tiberius, do you want to drink this?
-speak Orion 
No!
What is it?
I check it for 18.
-speak Sam 
For what?
-speak Orion 
For whatever you're trying to hand to me.
-speak Matt 
18 arcana?
Okay.
You take a look at it.
It definitely is magical, you don't have a lot of experience with alchemy but you gather that the effect that it would have upon imbibement would be to alter your physical form in some way, you just don't know the specific effects.
-speak Orion 
Absolutely, Scanlan, I'll take that for now.
And I put it in my pouch.
-speak Taliesin 
Let's take a short rest.
-speak Matt 
So, as you guys all kind of enter this room, this brief safe zone to take a short rest, if you feel you want to heal yourself up and regain any short rest-based abilities, do so.
-speak Marisha 
Can we talk about what this duergar just told us?
-speak Laura 
Can we go to the bathroom before we do that?
-speak Matt 
That's what I was going to say.
We can return– So we're going to take a quick bathroom break, we're going to play the videos again, we'll return here in just a second, as the next element of the attack on Emberhold continues.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, and this is your last chance because after the break we'll pick a winner for the Espionage giveaway.
So, last chance if you want to tweet @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole and look at our sweet nails!
They're awesome.
They're cool.
-speak Matt 
(whispers) Galaxies!
All right, see you guys in a second.
-speak Orion 
I have text and whatnot.
Break

[break]
Part II

-speak Matt 
Welcome back, guys!
All right, so we've had ourselves sufficiently rested.
-speak Zac 
Indeed we have.
We have a Tabletop Promo Day kit to give away, because you guys got the 50 subs since we started today.
-speak Matt 
Which is awesome.
-speak Zac 
And we'll give away another one with another signed poster at the end of the night if you get another 50.
So we're about to give this away, but I just want to remind you guys to donate to 826LA.
That's the group that Critical Role is supporting, and these guys are here out of the graces of their heart, and it would be very helpful for you guys to donate to them and show your love for Critical Role by donating to the charity.
We'll post the link in the chat.
Get those donations rolling!
-speak Matt 
Awesome.
-speak Zac 
Zac out!
-speak Matt 
All right, thank you, Zac!
Couple of quick things.
You wanted to announce the Espionage–
-speak Marisha 
Yes!
Our winner for the Espionage Bath Bombs Tabletop from @espionagemakeup goes to (drumroll) Dani Carr.
Who is @Eleine35.
So, Dani, I'm pretty sure you follow me on Twitter, just PM me your address and I'll get these out to you.
And thank you!
-speak Matt 
Yeah, did you follow him?
Because you have to follow him–
-speak Marisha 
Oh, I have to follow– Oh, well then I'll follow Dani right now.
-speak Matt 
Awesome!
Also, as a heads-up, guys, we've had some people perpetually asking us about the shirts that we made.
-speak Orion 
You mean these shirts?
-speak Matt 
That shirt right there.
So, we have a– it's a temporary– it's very basic, but we have up, if you guys ever want to go to critrole.
com, we have a limited run of those shirts currently available for purchase.
-speak Marisha 
Very limited, like once they're gone, they're gone.
-speak Laura 
It's less than– probably less than 15 of each size, less than that, probably.
It was a small amount.
-speak Liam 
I was wearing mine earlier today and I only rolled 20s.
Only.
-speak Marisha 
It's true.
So, it's www.
critrole.
com, and, yeah, and the site is still under construction, so.
But we managed to rush it out, and I wanna give a huge shout-out to Michael Whitesman, who's a big friend of ours, for helping us make the website.
-speak Orion 
Thanks, Whitey!
-speak Marisha 
@whitesly, if you want to bug him, and, yeah, so, if you buy–
-speak Orion 
That's his nickname!
It's not like a–
-speak Marisha 
Whitesly!
His last name is Whitesly.
-speak Orion 
I know.
But I said, 
-speak Orion 
What's up Whitey,
-speak Orion 
like, to him personally, and then they look at me like, 
-speak Orion 
Oh my lord, that's so racist.
(laughter)

-speak Orion 
And I'm like, no, no, it's his nickname.
It's okay.
-speak Matt 
That is actually his nickname.
-speak Liam 
I'm just sad that you don't call me Whitey.
-speak Orion 
I mean, I can.
-speak Liam 
Okay.
Let's start.
After this game.
-speak Marisha 
Anyways.
Anyways, you can go buy t-shirts now, which was the whole point of that.
At critrole.
com.
And there's a limited run.
Once they're gone, they're gone.
-speak Matt 
The cost includes shipping.
We'll get– we're packaging them ourselves.
We'll have, hopefully, more in the future, but this is the first attempt at trying to do something like this for you guys, so–
-speak Marisha 
Yeah.
We're doing this all ourselves just to, just 'cause– See how this works.
You guys–
-speak Laura 
And that includes the shipping, that's why the price is–
-speak Ashley 
So future t-shirts– Were you guys saying something, like it would be artwork from–
-speak Marisha 
Yes, this was, we got this from @rusegafdi.
He wore this at Tabletop Day, so–
-speak Laura 
A very similar design, so yeah.
-speak Marisha 
Yeah, so we're– we decided we're going to do, like, fan-designed t-shirts.
So, once every so often, we'll do a fan-designed t-shirt, and yes.
And then– but they'll all be limited, so yeah!
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
Shipping, shipping is included with the price, guys, don't worry.
But yeah.
So, anyway, check that out!
Thank you guys so much, and let's go ahead and get back to the game proper.
-speak Crew 
Hey, the t-shirts are sold out already.
They're now sold out.
They bought all of them.
-speak Marisha 
T-shirts are sold out!
-speak Orion 
Wait, what?
-speak Taliesin 
We didn't even finish telling you people!
-speak Laura 
No they're not.
-speak Taliesin 
Let us finish our sentence first!
-speak Matt 
Okay, so, so, so the limited run was very limited–
-speak Marisha 
Holy shit!
-speak Matt 
I guess we'll have to order some more, then.
-speak Sam 
Uh, mental note: make more t-shirts.
-speak Marisha 
We didn't know!
We didn't know!
-speak Matt 
We were gauging interest.
I guess there's interest.
-speak Marisha 
I'm sorry!
Now I almost feel guilty.
Congratulations to the 100 people who got 'em.
-speak Orion 
Hold on.
Tiberius is gonna work some magic, and then try to conjure up a few more.
He was unaware there was a shortage of, of those– okay.
-speak Matt 
Sorry, guys, all right, well, we'll– thank you guys very much, we'll get more to you very soon.
-speak Marisha 
I don't know what to say!
Oh god, I'm like, going to cry.
-speak Laura 
Second run, yeah!
Just hashtag them critical role and we'll– oh, but if you're selling them already, there's somebody that's making really cool t-shirts on Redbubble, but if you're making them there, like, we can't print them too, so, like, just submit them to us, and then we can–
-speak Matt 
Yeah, we'll figure it out!
Anyway, guys, thank you so much!
Let's get to the game!
-speak Taliesin 
Thank you!
Cool!
-speak Sam 
Guys, guys, the chatroom just solved the Israeli-Palestinian conflict!
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Thank you so much, chat!
Nice.
-speak Taliesin 
We've got a box of stuff coming right for you right now.
Thank you.
-speak Marisha 
Oh my god, I'm like, shaking.
-speak Matt 
All right, so.
For all who didn't get 'em, we'll have more soon, I promise.
-speak Liam 
Do you guys like D&D?
What is that?
-speak Marisha 
(laughs) We didn't know if people liked our show or not!
-speak Matt 
So.
So.
So, you've housed yourselves into this enchanting room, this magical laboratory, and taken about a 15-minute rest.
You're able to use any of your unused hit dice to heal yourself up if need be.
Any–
-speak Ashley 
Oh, well, where's everybody at?
'Cause maybe I can just do a– some healing up.
-speak Taliesin 
I just spent a healing surge, so.
-speak Laura 
Well, he's, well, as far as health goes–
-speak Liam 
I'm low, yeah, I'm pretty low.
-speak Ashley 
Yeah, what are you at?
-speak Matt 
How many hit dice do you have left?
-speak Liam 
I know, I have, I don't have that many left.
I'm at, like– I accidentally erased it, but I believe I'm at 30?
-speak Ashley 
Ooh, yeah, you– I need to, I'll get on that.
Anybody else?
What's everybody at?
-speak Sam 
I can sing to you and give you an extra little roll.
-speak Liam 
I'd like you to sing to me, either in the game or on another day.
-speak Sam 
Are you Vex or Vax?
(laughs)
-speak Liam 
I'm Vix.
-speak Sam 
All right, I'll sing to you and– are you gonna use a dice?
-speak Liam 
Thank you.
Ah, let me see how beautiful your song is
-speak Sam 
(sings) Heal the Vax, make him a better elf.
SAM and ASHLEY: (sings) For you and for me and the entire adventuring band.
-speak Sam 
(sings) There are duergar dying, if you cared enough for the adventurers, you'd bring Vax back to help us with the stabby-stab.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-speak Liam 
And please, vaccinate your kids.
(laughter)

-speak Liam 
I mean, don't Vax-inate them.
-speak Matt 
Yeah, there's the difference.
All right, so.
-speak Sam 
You get a 1d6 for that.
-speak Matt 
So, an extra 1d6 healing to anyone.
-speak Liam 
Who needs more than one?
Three, okay.
-speak Ashley 
I healed you, 18, which was actually low, but I rolled really high for each roll.
That's my–
-speak Liam 
Oh, thanks.
That's very good.
Okay, great, I am almost tip-top condition, thank you.
I have a blister.
-speak Matt 
So, as you guys manage to pull yourself out of your rest mode, you now glance out, and the hallway's still quiet, you can hear the movement of footsteps up above you.
What is your intent?
-speak Sam 
To win!
-speak Marisha 
Okay.
Wait, what are we gonna do, 'cause here's– there's an army waiting upstairs for us?
-speak Liam 
They know we're up there, but Kima needs her stuff, and we need to kind of put an end to this problem.
-speak Marisha 
I'm gonna hop out of tiger form, by the way, since we rested and stuff.
-speak Sam 
Wait, they're above us?
-speak Liam 
Yeah, they're all upstairs, including the mind flayer who vanished from the room we're in, so I'm sure he told everyone what's going on.
But they don't know we've found the secret entrance, so I think we should go– Vex'ahlia's correct, we should use the stairwell near the secret entrance.
-speak Orion 
Are we sure there's no other way out of here, through this particular floor?
Is that the only exit?
-speak Laura 
There's– I mean, there's the front entrance, there's that door over there, there's like two other stairways, but we should use this back one, by the back entrance.
-speak Liam 
Also, Lady Kima, our purpose here was to find you, but your purpose is somewhat greater than our own.
What do you suggest we do in this moment?
-speak Matt 
As she stands up, and she holds the greatsword and swings it a bit.
-speak Matt 
What I'm seeking lies deeper into this cavern.
Whatever is at the heart of this illithid scourge.
-speak Matt 
And she glances over at Clarota– who's in the back corner, hands folded– and there's a slight mental hiss sound in her direction.
-speak Matt 
There's something far darker at the heart of this temple.
I've seen it.
But I have my thoughts and my ideas, but I need confirmation before I speak of any doom-saying.
However, the link between those foul creatures and the assault that's currently mounting against Kraghammer lie upstairs at the center of this duergar people.
-speak Sam 
Oh, here?
Here at– where we are now?
Yes, here?
-speak Matt 
The link between this K'varn character–
-speak Liam 
And let me ask you this.
We can be on the same page, we can go up and fuck shit up.
However, your weapons and armor– would they be a great help?
Should they be our short-term purpose, or should we just go up and try to end this problem?
-speak Matt 
To be honest, we've entirely lost the element of surprise.
I would not wish to sacrifice as foolishly for a few additional trinkets of my own when I feel that this should do well enough, as long as we manage to work together and be smart about this.
-speak Laura 
So we should potentially just leave this castle for now and go find K'varn, rest up–
-speak Sam 
No, no, no.
-speak Liam 
No, Kima is saying this is the main event.
-speak Sam 
She just said there's a link upstairs.
The link from– to K'varn that we need to–
-speak Laura 
I get it!
Okay.
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
How do you think K'varn is able to send these armies up again and again towards the back door of Kraghammer?
-speak Laura 
Right.
-speak Matt 
Besides, if we go on and leave them as they are, who's to say they wouldn't come up behind us, and then we're fighting a two-sided front once we get there?
-speak Laura 
Then let's– We gotta go upstairs.
-speak Liam 
Vox Machina, our years are short.
Let's make good use of them.
-speak Sam 
Let's leave this decision up to Grog.
-speak Orion 
Absolutely not!
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Grog's standing there clutching his greataxe.
-speak Matt 
I say, I haven't been able to kill much since we got here.
Let's kill something!
-speak Orion 
That's a terrible idea.
-speak Laura 
Have some ale before we go out, Grog.
-speak Matt 
Oh, yeah, of course.
-speak Laura 
This could potentially kill us all.
-speak Matt 
(as Grog) Vox Machina.
-speak All 
Vox Machina!
-speak Laura 
Scanlan had a great idea, though.
Should we talk about what Scanlan wants to do?
-speak Sam 
Ah, yes, I have an idea.
But also, are there two stairs up to the top floor?
-speak Liam 
There's multiple.
-speak Sam 
Perhaps we should use more than one.
One, half of our band go up, create a diversion.
The other half sneak up and kill, kill, kill.
That's one option.
The other option–
-speak Liam 
Pike leads the diversion group.
-speak Ashley 
Definitely the stealthy ones with me.
(laughter)

-speak Sam 
Ah, I do have an idea about gaining the upper hand on our first meeting with this army that's upstairs.
An intimidation technique of some sort.
-speak Marisha 
You're not going to kill another pony, are you?
-speak Sam 
I can't anymore.
-speak Marisha 
Good.
-speak Sam 
Much as I would love to.
No, but we've heard over our eavesdropping that some of these duergar bastards are scared of that strange chimera sort of hodgepodge, human centipede thing?
We could be one of those with a little bit of deception, and all of us sort of piling on each other.
We could act like a big scary monster and go up and freak the fuck out of them.
-speak Marisha 
Ah!
That's actually a really good idea.
-speak Laura 
– all of us piled on Grog and Trinket and you as the bases, and we become this–
-speak Sam 
They would probably be, at least for the moment, intimidated a bit, and we could get a few licks in before they realized we're just a pile of idiots running at them.
(laughter)

-speak Laura 
I like it.
-speak Marisha 
So we're basically gonna be like three kids Little Rascals-style on each other's shoulders with a giant coat?
-speak Sam 
But that could be the diversion, at least.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, well then, why don't– I actually like this idea.
Why don't we have a few of our stealthy members, why don't we have the twins be in the shadows, and picking people off while–
-speak Laura 
That's true, 'cause I've got range, so that makes sense.
-speak Marisha 
Right, why don't we have some of our ranged people– I'll transform.
I can transform into– how about a giant scorpion?
That sounds fun.
-speak Sam 
Can you transform into anything?
-speak Marisha 
I can transform into beasts.
They have to be beasts.
-speak Sam 
How about the type of beast that we know would scare them, like that big triceratops thing that we saw with the big metal thing on it.
-speak Marisha 
I can be a rhinoceros– I can be, like– Can I do dinosaurs?
I can be a dinosaur, right?
That's a new thing I can be, right?
-speak Matt 
Up to a certain point.
-speak Liam 
What if you were a scorpion, with a dragonborn tail sliding around and a gnome on your front leg and a–
-speak Marisha 
Well here's, oh wait wait, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, this might be crazy– wonder what would happen if I drank that weird yellowish potion?
While I'm a monster?
-speak Laura 
No, It could be poison, though.
-speak Marisha 
But I'm wondering if you can, like, if I can transform into a monster and then you with Polymorph can maybe just transform.
-speak Orion 
Stop talking, stop talking!
Hold on.
(laughter)

-speak Marisha 
You don't have to snap at me.
-speak Orion 
No, no, no, you're brilliant, your highness.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, thank you.
I mean.
-speak Orion 
I have an idea, I have an idea.
-speak Liam 
We're off the rails, here.
-speak Laura 
Tell it to us, Tiberius, what's the idea?
-speak Sam 
Does it involve shitting on a bed?
(laughter)

-speak Orion 
Eventually, actually, yes.
-speak Taliesin 
Aren't you empty yet?
-speak Orion 
This is what's going to happen.
As far as we know, they're all duergar up there, correct?
-speak Laura 
Mostly, except for the mind flayers.
And another big monster probably, they might have–
-speak Ashley 
Which I saw in a vision.
I think that's what's controlling them
-speak Laura 
Oh no, that's K'varn.
No, no, no, he's at the other one.
-speak Ashley 
Sorry, read it wrong.
-speak Orion 
This is what will happen.
Those who can go stealth, we will creep up there.
I will go invisible myself.
I will be in front.
You closely behind me.
-speak Sam 
He has a name.
-speak Orion 
Vax.
There we go.
You closely behind me, and whoever else can stealth follows suit.
I will cast Alter Self and turn myself into their god.
-speak Sam 
Their god?
-speak All 
K'varn?
-speak Marisha 
But you don't know what he looks like.
-speak Laura 
Oh, or into that other thingie.
-speak Orion 
I absolutely know what he looks like.
-speak Matt 
You mean Laduguer?
-speak Orion 
We just saw his statue.
-speak Marisha 
Well.
that's not K'varn though.
-speak Orion 
But that's who they worship.
As I give my, whatever the hell I come up with to say at that particular time–
-speak Sam 
Maybe you should think it first, think it through first.
-speak Orion 
As soon as the mind flayers catch on, and I turn to Clarota, and I turn to Kima, that's when all of you will strike at them first.
The rest of you will wait 'til I shoot off a couple of Fireballs at the duergar once they figure out we're full of crap.
'Cause I'm sure that might happen unless I'm super convincing, which I hope that's the case– But I think that's our best bet to keep a certain element of surprise.
-speak Marisha 
So wait, so wait, are you going to be their god, and I'm still going to also be a crazy monster, as like your pet crazy monster, with our stealthy team, or just–
-speak Taliesin 
I think the only thing better than their god would be their god on top of a giant scorpion.
LAURA and MARISHA: Ooh!
-speak Liam 
I have faith in you, Tiberius.
-speak Marisha 
You'll be like Xerxes.
-speak Ashley 
Can I cast, 'cause I've been wanting to use Thaumaturgy.
Which can make your voice three times as louder.
-speak Matt 
At the moment he would be speaking, yeah.
-speak Ashley 
At the moment he'd be speaking, okay, so let's do that.
-speak Laura 
Oh, that's going to be so cool.
-speak Marisha 
Some theatrics.
-speak Liam 
I love it when a good plan comes together.
-speak Sam 
So some of us are stealthing, you're being a big god who talks loud and is riding a scorpion.
-speak Ashley 
So maybe I'll tuck behind him, on top of you the scorpion, and then when you're getting ready to talk I'll just (whoosh) and then you'll– your voice will be, you know, you'll have–
-speak Liam 
Yeah, that's good, that's good.
-speak Sam 
How about this– so, just to clarify, are we all going up the same staircase, or are we going up two separate staircases, Vex and Vax–
-speak Laura 
I think we should just go up the same staircase.
There's too many of them.
If we split up we could just all die.
-speak Sam 
You don't know what– there could be a million rooms up there.
-speak Liam 
We have no idea what's up there, but Tiberius has got a plan, I like it.
-speak Laura 
If he's the god, we just go in behind him as the god.
-speak Ashley 
What if we did like your Dimension Door?
Is it too not very god-like if he's coming up the staircase like, hey?
-speak Sam 
The Dimension Door's off the table.
-speak Liam 
Tiberius, Tiberius.
Tibs.
-speak Sam 
But don't use the god thing.
But don't use the god thing until we get to the big group.
The big thing, if you see a guard, don't turn into a god, you gotta see like more than five people before you turn into a god.
-speak Liam 
Tiberius.
-speak Orion 
Yes, Vax?
-speak Liam 
Do you intend to go up one of the other stairways?
I believe this one by the entrance, the secret entrance we came in, will afford us the element of surprise.
Do you think you want to go up one of the others?
-speak Orion 
No, let's go up that one.
-speak Liam 
And make a distraction, right?
Your plan is to make a distraction.
-speak Orion 
Yes, of course.
-speak Liam 
You're a brave dragonborn.
-speak Marisha 
I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on the party.
Everyone stay close.
-speak Liam 
Who's the stealth party, not you, you and me, you.
-speak Marisha 
Well, all of us, all of us I guess, until we get upstairs.
-speak Laura 
Potentially all of us will be stealthed except for Tiberius, and you who is a scorpion, and you who's riding behind Tiberius.
-speak Ashley 
I'm riding on her, so I probably won't be rolling for stealth.
-speak Matt 
Uh.
-speak Ashley 
Just kidding.
-speak Matt 
You'll be rolling.
-speak Ashley 
I probably won't roll well, just putting it out there.
-speak Matt 
You hear in the back of your mind this subtle, soft, echoing chuckle.
-speak Matt 
You're all crazy.
I like it.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
At which point, Kima, who's listening to all this with a look of kind of awe and curiosity says, 
-speak Matt 
You know, for once?
I actually agree with the thing.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Matt 
Takes her greatsword in her hands.
-speak Matt 
Lead the way.
-speak Ashley 
So you guys are stealthing up first?
-speak Marisha 
We all have Pass Without a Trace as long as you stand close enough.
-speak Liam 
Wait, wait for the inspiration.
-speak Sam 
I have some inspiration dice to give out, that I can give out as bonus actions.
Can I give it out before we go into battle?
-speak Matt 
I would say like momentarily, right beforehand.
-speak Sam 
Okay, good to know.
But I can't mass give it out, just have to give it to one person.
-speak Matt 
It's one of those things where it has to be in the moment when the adrenaline's pumping, I think, for it to last into the combat.
-speak Sam 
Okay, and do we want to send Clarota and Kima off through a different staircase so we have at least a backup plan?
-speak Laura 
No, no, no stick together.
Too big of a group of an army upstairs to split us up.
-speak Liam 
Don't split the party.
-speak Sam 
In those action movies, when there's one guy who goes away for a while, he comes back at the end and saves the day.
If we did that–
-speak Laura 
That's not going to be us!
-speak Liam 
We few, we happy few.
(laughter)

-speak Liam 
About to go and do something very stupid.
Let's do it.
-speak Matt 
So you are venturing up which stairway?
-speak Laura 
The secret one, the one by– in the storage room.
-speak Matt 
All right.
So.
You guys–
-speak Marisha 
We got this.
We got this.
-speak Laura 
Oh no, Grog fell over.
Oh my gosh.
-speak Marisha 
It's been a good day.
What are you going to say?
Are you thinking about this?
Think about something.
-speak Orion 
Okay.
-speak Marisha 
Start thinking about this now.
-speak Liam 
There are rooms up there.
-speak Taliesin 
What's the name of the god again?
-speak Marisha 
Laduguer.
-speak Ashley 
Can I take off my armor right now?
-speak Matt 
You'd become a soft target.
All right, you guys all make your way up, and you're all squeezing into this tiny, tiny room.
You're all shoulder-to-shoulder, essentially.
You come up to the top area, there's a small box, and there is just a single stone door.
-speak Laura 
Check for traps.
-speak Liam 
Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, excuse me Kima, sorry, sorry, All right, my hands are on the door.
I'm going to check for traps on this door.
I get a 21.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you take a moment and you place your hand along this stone surface.
You find that there's a low hum to it.
-speak Liam 
Careful, careful, careful.
-speak Matt 
And you can tell that there's a small, almost like a thin whisper of string laid across the very top of the stone, where the wall meets it.
-speak Liam 
Of course I can, of course I can.
I'm going to take care of this, hold on.
Yeah, this is thieves' tools, correct?
26.
-speak Matt 
26, okay.
You come up and you find that this is a very, very fine hair trigger.
This is actually a partial enchantment as part of a magical trap.
You know that with the slightest hint of false vibration to it, the door shifting or hitting it in the wrong place will trigger whatever this trap is.
And so you bring your tools up, you manage to place one at the base of each point at where this arcane silver thread lies across.
Simultaneously, you take your daggers and place them underneath the thread at each ends and sever them both at the same time.
The thin whisper of a string just slowly glides down and vanishes into a small sparkle of light.
-speak Sam 
Cut the red wire.
-speak Liam 
I'm just going to lay my ear on the door and see what I can hear.
That is 21.
-speak Matt 
Hearing it, you hear what sounds like a low mutter of somewhere in the neighbourhood of ten to 15 low voices, and the slow, small shuffling of many, many, many, many footsteps.
-speak Liam 
Shuffling, you said?
And if I listen for a moment, do I– does it continue?
-speak Matt 
It, kind of, couple of footsteps, some talking, soft footprints.
You can hear the scraping of metal–
-speak Liam 
And it's the only way we can go is through this door, right?
We're all smooshed into this hallway–
-speak Matt 
There is a hallway this way.
-speak Laura 
Oh, so we stealth down the other hall, we try.
-speak Liam 
So I mooshed everyone away from this hall.
-speak Matt 
The whispers and voices aren't directly on the other side of this wall, they're just in that room echoing through, but you do hear a lot of people there.
All right, so, what are you doing?
-speak Laura 
Well, well, stealthing down that hallway.
Can we check for traps, check for traps, I look, I'm perceiving.
-speak Matt 
(laughs) Roll for perceiving
(laughter)

-speak Liam 
23 for Vax.
-speak Laura 
Oh, I get twice that, good.
Oh, good, that was way better.
-speak Matt 
(laughs)
-speak Laura 
Ten.
-speak Matt 
Okay, no traps.
-speak Laura 
Yay!
-speak Matt 
You both glide your way up and peek around the corner.
What you see immediately are six duergar all stationed in this hallway guarding what looks like two large doors and entrance to this main chamber.
And they're all just standing there, weapons ready, looking around.
-speak Sam 
Wait, which is the main chamber that you just–
-speak Matt 
This big chamber here that you–
-speak Sam 
Oh, that we were listening to at the door.
-speak Liam 
Vax sneaks back to the group and motions Tiberius over, and Keyleth over.
-speak Sam 
We're doing this?
-speak Liam 
One moment, one moment.
Lightning, Lightning, who knows Lightning?
-speak Marisha 
Are you gonna try to Lightning Bolt an entire line?
-speak Liam 
Do you know the magic of lightning?
I've seen you do it before, I've seen you.
-speak Marisha 
I do know it right now.
-speak Liam 
You know it?
Anyone who knows Lightning, I've seen it done on the battlefield with us, person to person to person.
-speak Sam 
I can do it.
-speak Matt 
Who is up once again, clearing his throat in your presence.
-speak Sam 
Hi!
Scanlan here.
-speak Liam 
Scanlan, you know how to harness the power of electricity.
-speak Sam 
I don't wanna brag, but I'm a regular Ben Franklin over here.
He's a guy, he's a gnome I knew once.
-speak Marisha 
Scanlan, can you and I focus our Call Lightning spells together?
To Lightning these–
-speak Sam 
I mean, mine's so fricking powerful.
-speak Liam 
If Scanlan and one of the others does Lightning at the same time and it goes through that line, we could drop them all at once.
-speak Laura 
But that's noisy, they'll come out.
-speak Liam 
It's not that noisy, it's not like armor banging around.
-speak Laura 
I think it's gonna be noisy, it's not a stealthy attack.
-speak Taliesin 
It's a quick way to get rid of six people, though.
-speak Orion 
Oh, is that what we need to do?
-speak Liam 
There's a row of duergar around the corner, they're all in a line like Radio City, we just– if I can get– Scanlan, if you– what about you, Keyleth?
Do I remember light– or do you bring it down from above?
Tiberius.
-speak Orion 
What, what?
-speak Sam 
Do you want me to shock 'em?
-speak Orion 
Oh, I have an idea.
Okay, I'll peek around.
-speak Matt 
Okay, make a stealth check.
-speak Orion 
Sweet.
-speak Marisha 
You have plus ten because of my Pass Without a Trace.
-speak Liam 
You've got six duergar in a row.
Is there anything you can do that's–
-speak Orion 
27.
-speak Matt 
That's when you see this long row of duergar that are all kind of armored and ready, guarding the front of this chamber.
-speak Orion 
I cast Watery Sphere at the end of the last guy and create a giant ball.
-speak Liam 
Wait, you're doing it now?
-speak Orion 
What does it look like, Vax?
-speak Matt 
Okay, so this giant water sphere appears.
At which side of the wall?
-speak Orion 
On the last guy.
Yeah, and I draw it towards us.
-speak Liam 
Vax is grabbing the gnome and tossing him out to the right, out here at the front of the group.
-speak Orion 
And I stop at the last guy.
-speak Matt 
Okay, as the water sphere begins to pull in.
Saving throws, what's your DC?
-speak Orion 
My spell DC, 17.
-speak Matt 
This is a dexterity save?
All right.
-speak Sam 
One at a time.
-speak Matt 
All of them fail!
(cheering)

-speak Marisha 
This is gonna be cool, this is gonna be cool.
It's gonna put them all in one spot.
-speak Sam 
They were already in a line.
-speak Marisha 
No, now we can electrocute them and they're wet!
-speak Matt 
There is now an entire clustered sphere of water that is containing a mishmash of duergar.
-speak Marisha 
Lightning Bolt!
-speak Matt 
Call Lightning.
All right, so, as Keyleth, you step forward, out in the hallway, you bring your arm up and there's this small cluster of dark clouds beginning to form and swirl up on the top of the 20-foot hallway.
As it swirls, you bring your arm downward, and there's a sudden crack of thunder, a loud blasting sound that echoes through the hallway.
As the lightning strikes the center of the sphere, the water itself bursts as the actual cacophonous blast of the lightning loosely shakes the aquatic sphere.
However, go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Marisha 
Do I get any more damage because of the–
-speak Matt 
You get an additional two dice of damage to each one of the duergar because they are contained in the water.
-speak Orion 
Yeah!
-speak Marisha 
So 5d10?
-speak Matt 
Correct.
-speak Marisha 
Do I roll for each one?
-speak Matt 
You just roll once, and that's across the board for all of them, and they are at a disadvantage because they are in the sphere.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, and they're at a disadvantage?
-speak Orion 
Yeah, yeah, because I'm like holding them up.
-speak Marisha 
All right.
-speak Matt 
It's really funny, because two of them rolled 20s in a row, but they're at a disadvantage.
-speak Marisha 
Nice.
Not too shabby.
So we have ten, 19 plus 18, bringing it to 28 plus three, 31 plus one.
32.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
So the sphere explodes, the actual stone on the ground you can feel shake and shudder with the impact of the lightning storm.
All but one of the duergar are blown apart and scattered across the wall Akira-style, just (splat) against the walls.
One of them is still in the center of the sphere, now looking charred and burnt, and eyes wide open with anger and frustration.
-speak Marisha 
Scanlan, go!
-speak Sam 
I say, (chants) you ugly, you ugly, yo mama says you ugly!
And I cast Vicious Mockery.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
He rolled a 14 vs the DC which I think is–
-speak Sam 
19.
-speak Matt 
All right, how much total did you do?
-speak Sam 
Just a five.
-speak Matt 
How much did you do, total?
-speak Marisha 
32, total.
-speak Matt 
Hold on.
So as the duergar is currently held aloft in this aquatic sphere, half-charred and burnt with pieces of his friends floating in the water around him, he hears through this kind of warbling sound, 
-speak Matt 
You ugly, you ugly,
-speak Matt 
and he sees everyone kind of step in the hallway clapping with you, and he kind of looks around at himself, looks at his situation… and eventually just gives up and takes a big old gulp of water and drowns inside the aquatic sphere.
(laughter)

-speak Sam 
Yes!
I shamed him to death
-speak Ashley 
Amazing.
-speak Marisha 
(laughs) What a terrible way to die.
-speak Matt 
Good news is, you guys royally screwed over six duergar, one of which you shamed him to death.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
You have definitely, however, announced your presence at the chamber.
-speak Liam 
Vax spanks Tiberius on the tail and says, get ready to deity!
Going stealth.
-speak Marisha 
I say– I go, get on my back, get on my back, and I piggyback him.
-speak Matt 
You transform?
-speak Orion 
I do.
-speak Matt 
No, Marisha, did you transform?
-speak Marisha 
Well I'm piggybacking him, just now.
I'm literally just piggybacking Tiberius waiting.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so Tiberius, you leap onto her back.
-speak Orion 
Mm-hm, and I cast Alter Self, and I turn to–
-speak Liam 
Scanlan, Vex.
-speak Ashley 
I'm going to cast the thing on him.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so you cast Thaumaturgy on him to give him a vocal emphasis, a roaring, booming voice.
Do you stay with him or do you move back with the rest of the group?
-speak Marisha 
Oh, oh, Pike Pike Pike Pike Pike.
What kind of animal would this god use?
Would you know what kind of animal the duergar would worship?
Do you know?
-speak Orion 
It's a religion check.
-speak Matt 
Religion check.
-speak Marisha 
What kind of animals he might like?
You know, check out– you know, animals.
-speak Ashley 
14.
-speak Matt 
You have no idea.
You know the deity exists, you don't know of any sort of animal, beast or creature symbolism that would befit a duergar god.
-speak Ashley 
I have no idea.
-speak Marisha 
I guess a scorpion, a scorpion sounds good?
Scorpion.
Giant Scorpion.
-speak Matt 
Keyleth's form shifts.
As you see a bunch of arachnid-like legs sprawl out the side of her torso, her form condenses into a dark, chitinous shell as two giant claws form out the side of her body, and a giant poison stinger curls up from behind.
Tiberius kind of holds on during the transformation–
-speak Ashley 
I'm going to go back, because if they see me, then they'll know something's fishy.
-speak Matt 
All right, the rest of you are here.
So.
You feel this kind of divine energy cascade around your throat.
You can feel your vocal cords themselves are temporarily infused with some sort of divine presence.
You've transformed yourself now into the visage of this duergar deity.
Standing at probably a good– what height are you going at?
-speak Orion 
How tall are the–
-speak Matt 
The duergar are about four-and-a-half feet tall.
-speak Orion 
So let's make him six feet tall.
-speak Matt 
All right, six-foot-tall duergar standing there.
-speak Laura 
The two of us get back by the other twin door, and get ready to bust into that entrance.
-speak Sam 
I'm with them.
We're the stealth party.
-speak Liam 
I'm in fact nudging Grog away from this door towards the front towards Tiberius.
I don't know, they're not that strong.
-speak Matt 
What are you doing?
Grog says, 
-speak Matt 
Which way, which way do I go?
-speak Liam 
Vax kicks Grog in the butt and sends him forward.
Go help Tiberius!
-speak Matt 
I'm walking back for you.
-speak Laura 
Grog, don't do that.
Not that far.
Grog, come back, because if they see him–
-speak Orion 
No, stay in the corner, Grog.
Wait 'til I say help me, and then come kill everything.
-speak Matt 
He looks like he's listening.
Mostly.
(laughter)

-speak Marisha 
Back him up.
Back him up.
-speak Matt 
You hear shifting in the doorway from the front where you guys are.
What's the plan?
What's doing what?
-speak Sam 
Who's going in first?
-speak Orion 
Is this going to be the entrance where we're going in?
-speak Laura 
Yeah you bust in and be a god.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, are we busting in?
-speak Laura 
When you give it, we'll go in the other way.
-speak Marisha 
Fuck if I know.
-speak Orion 
That's your job.
Bust the door open.
-speak Matt 
All right, go ahead and make an athletics check.
-speak Liam 
I'm simultaneously checking our door for– no, I already did.
It's unlocked, and untrapped.
Never mind.
-speak Marisha 
Giant scorpion.
Athletics.
Plus my dex, I'm assuming?
-speak Matt 
No, plus your strength.
-speak Marisha 
Strength, that's pretty cool, though.
22.
-speak Matt 
A 22.
-speak Marisha 
I rolled a 19.
-speak Matt 
All right, the doors splinter open.
The doors are actually broken off the hinges.
-speak Orion 
As that happens, I cast Light and I cast Prestidigitation.
-speak Sam 
Concentrate.
Don't cast too much shit.
-speak Orion 
I can't hear what's going on.
I hear some annoyances in the background as I cast Prestidigitation to make my voice louder.
-speak Laura 
No, she already did it.
It's three times louder than it normally would be.
-speak Orion 
Oh, shit.
-speak Marisha 
So just keep focusing on your Light.
-speak Matt 
As you guys come bursting in–
-speak Liam 
Holy shit.
-speak Laura 
Yeah, there's a lot of them.
-speak Marisha 
Maybe do some Prestidigitation where you move shit around.
-speak Ashley 
Oh ho ho.
What!
-speak Marisha 
Oh!
Hello, everybody.
LIAM and LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to rage.
-speak Laura 
Oh, no.
Basilisks!
-speak Liam 
What?
-speak Laura 
Those thingies!
-speak Marisha 
Oh, that's right, they have those pet basilisks.
Remember?
-speak Matt 
So the doors burst open and you guys come through.
All of the duergar stand there with their weapons at the ready.
You can see in the back, on this raised platform, where the cloth stops, there is two thrones, at the top two duergar sitting on the thrones at the ready.
You can see two kind of lizard-like creatures in the back on chained leashes.
However, all of the duergar that are ready to strike as you burst through, take a step back, looking extremely confused about what's going on.
-speak Orion 
(shouts) Silence!
All of you, silence!
-speak Sam 
We weren't talking.
-speak Orion 
Who knows who I am?
-speak Matt 
Make a persuasion check.
-speak Marisha 
Get it.
Get it.
Get it.
-speak Liam 
Yep.
Yep yep yep yep.
Vax is quietly moving along the back wall.
-speak Sam 
Our door is open?
-speak Liam 
It is now.
-speak Laura 
Yeah we're going to try to stealth in and sneak attack them.
-speak Orion 
16.
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
Oh god.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
The duergar in the front take another step back, looking both frightened and awed.
The one nearest to you takes his hammer and throws it to the ground, and takes a knee.
-speak Orion 
Well, it looks like there's one saved soul at this point in time.
-speak Matt 
At which point two of the other ones nearby kind of look at each other and look back at the one who's on the ground.
They put their hammers down, and they kneel as well.
At which point, in the back, you see the two throned figures stand up.
One of which you can barely see in the dim light outside of your Light spell that's currently gleaming above you.
This long, almost-touching-the-floor black, braided beard that drags right over this heavy-set plate of jagged black iron metal.
A giant sword in his hand.
-speak Matt 
You're kneeling below this false idol.
-speak Orion 
Silence!
-speak Matt 
This imposter!
-speak Orion 
As I cast– As I say silence, I blow a big plume of fire out of my mouth, and I cast Control Flames.
-speak Matt 
So the light (pff).
-speak Orion 
I don't cast Control Flames.
I just do the Fireball for effect.
I don't do Control Flames, because that's a concentration spell.
-speak Matt 
All right, so you do Fireball.
Where are you casting Fireball?
Or just doing it to do it?
-speak Orion 
Just (fwoosh).
-speak Matt 
Plume of flame.
Roll an intimidation check.
-speak Taliesin 
You guys, what are you doing right now?
-speak Liam 
I'm moving along the back wall.
I want that illithid.
-speak Orion 
18.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
Make a stealth check.
Who else is going in there with him?
-speak Laura 
I go in and stand at the walls next to the door.
-speak Liam 
32.
-speak Matt 
Okay, your stealth roll?
-speak Ashley 
I'm so stressed.
-speak Marisha 
I know!
I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
-speak Matt 
So you rolled a–
-speak Orion 
18.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you can see this figure– which you are gathering at this point is probably King Murghol– still holding his sword aloft, looks back towards his wife who's sitting in the throne next to him, who is just standing up kind of confused.
-speak Orion 
That's right, boy.
I am Laduguer!
You know, and you know your deeds as of late might upset my rest.
-speak Matt 
All of the duergar are now looking over their shoulders back towards the king and watching this transpire between the two of you.
-speak Orion 
(shouts) All of you, lay down your arms!
-speak Laura 
32.
-speak Matt 
32.
You're moving in, everyone else staying in the hallway?
-speak Ashley 
I'm not moving.
I'm like this!
-speak Matt 
As you guys push in further and further, the group that are kneeling move back in sheer fear and horror.
At which point the king takes a step down off of the throne area onto the next platform, weapons still at his side and says, 
-speak Matt 
Men, I've trained you.
I've raised you.
I've fed you and I've kept you alive.
-speak Orion 
And I don't care for you to finish that sentence!
I cast Fireball.
Right fucking– Right on him.
-speak Sam 
That's an attack right there.
-speak Orion 
Of course it is!
-speak Matt 
So the blast hits him and a 20-foot radius that will grab everything in that radius.
Including you.
So go ahead and roll damage.
8d6.
-speak Liam 
It's all right.
-speak Marisha 
8d6.
-speak Liam 
Heal me, Pike, heal me.
Heal me in three minutes, heal me.
This is gonna hurt.
This is gonna sting.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, god damn.
Come on, you got this.
You got this, Vax.
-speak Sam 
You want it to be a lot, but not too much.
(laughter)

-speak Liam 
A little less than 55.
-speak Orion 
Uh, 25.
-speak Matt 
25, okay.
-speak Orion 
Oh, I'm sorry, 30.
-speak Matt 
Okay, good.
So it explodes around them.
You see all of them kind of shield themselves from the blast of flame.
As it spreads out–
-speak Liam 
Wait, I'm doing the rogue thing that I can't remember the name for.
LAURA and MARISHA: Uncanny Dodge?
-speak Liam 
No, it's something else.
-speak Orion 
Quickly.
Quickly.
-speak Matt 
So while you're looking that up– The duergar brace themselves and they have an innate natural resistance against things magical in nature.
-speak Liam 
Evasion!
-speak Matt 
So they all take the brunt of the damage, however, it does not do as much as you hoped to the group.
All of them look hurt, but definitely not taken out of the fight.
The two lizard creatures you now have a better look at, you do see it's familiar.
They have numerous sets of legs, and though the chains hold them at bay, both of them glance up instinctually.
I want you, Tiberius, to make two constitution saving throws.
-speak Sam 
Traps.
-speak Orion 
Yes.
-speak Liam 
DM.
Evasion, if I make a success I get half-damage, if I fail I get– If I fail, I get half-damage, if I succeed I get no damage.
I think I failed.
I got a nine.
-speak Matt 
Yeah you take half-damage.
So you take the– What was the total damage on your Fireball?
So you take 15 points of fire damage.
So as you glance about the room now, you look over and both of these lizard creatures kind of look towards you.
You kind of look back and forth– there's a slight gleam in their eye.
Suddenly you feel your form begin to tighten up, instant.
You are considered restrained, which means you are at disadvantage to all your attack rolls and ability checks for right now.
-speak Orion 
Hold on, I still have a bonus attack I can do before that happens, correct?
-speak Matt 
No, this is as it's happening.
Your turn is still happening.
-speak Orion 
I got it.
-speak Matt 
This is all kind of a fluid moment.
Things happen as they happen until initiative is being rolled, which is now.
So everyone roll initiative.
-speak Marisha 
Sneaky sneaky.
-speak Laura 
Oh, great.
-speak Matt 
All right, so, 25 to 20?
-speak Sam 
Natural 20.
-speak Matt 
Plus your–
-speak Sam 
Nothing.
-speak Matt 
Plus nothing for dex.
Okay.
-speak Sam 
Oh, for dex.
Plus nothing.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so 25 to 20?
-speak Taliesin 
23.
-speak Liam 
21.
-speak Matt 
21, all right, all right.
-speak Taliesin 
Yeah.
Sneak attack.
-speak Matt 
All righty, 20 to 15?
-speak Laura 
19.
-speak Orion 
17.
-speak Matt 
All right, 15 to ten?
-speak Marisha 
I'm nine.
-speak Ashley 
Five.
Not to brag.
-speak Marisha 
(laughs) Big number five.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Marisha 
I just noticed your shirt.
It's really great.
-speak Sam 
Guys, tune in every week for this kind of intense action.
-speak Laura 
Unless we're all dead next week.
In which case–
-speak Liam 
– Mama put the coins on my eyes.
-speak Matt 
All right, that brings us to top of the round.
Percy, you're up.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to hold off until– I'm actually going to delay my turn until post-Pike.
-speak Orion 
Can I still yell out shit while this is happening?
Even though it isn't my turn?
-speak Matt 
I mean, you can yell like one thing.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm loud and I've got range, so I'm going to let the room fill, and then I'm going to come in and get some.
-speak Orion 
As this is all going down, I'm going to yell, those who want to live, throw down your arms.
That's what I do.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
That brings us back to the top.
Vax, you're up.
-speak Liam 
Okay, I use my bonus action to click my boots of haste together.
And I tap-dance over to the illithid, and I'm going to use two daggers to stab him in his eyeballs.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Liam 
First one hits, it's 18.
-speak Matt 
It is a critical because it does not see you and has not acted yet this combat.
-speak Liam 
Yeah it is.
So I just take my keen dagger and I shove it in his eyeball.
1d4 is two, plus–
-speak Marisha 
Feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
-speak Taliesin 
We're going to be fine.
It's nothing we can't handle.
-speak Marisha 
Nothing we can't handle.
-speak Liam 
19, 28, plus 36 is the first dagger into his eyeball.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Liam 
Second dagger also hits for a little less, for seven points of fire damage in his other eyeball.
-speak Matt 
All right.
Gotcha.
So the first one actually jams into one of its eyes.
It didn't even see you, it recoils back, slapping your hand back out of the way.
The other dagger strikes and just gleans off its shoulder.
However, it turns around with its other eye and it definitely knows you're there.
-speak Liam 
I'd like to circulate my hands to kind of carve out the eyeball area.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
No, it pushed you off.
-speak Liam 
Yeah, okay, okay, it's all right.
-speak Matt 
All right.
That brings us to Grog.
-speak Sam 
(Grog voice) I would like to rage.
-speak Liam 
(Grog voice) I would like to go to a whore house.
-speak Matt 
He goes into a rage.
And Grog is going to go ahead and take his axe with the chain on it and throw it toward the first duergar he sees, which is right here.
Throws it.
All right, that is a– That's going to miss.
He rolled a four.
Swings past.
He's going to make an athletics check to see if he can bring it back.
That he succeeds.
So he throws the axe.
It swings past the duergar, clangs to the ground, uses his chain, he yanks it back, catches it in his hand.
His turn is spent, however.
Next up is Scanlan.
-speak Sam 
I step into the room, lining myself up with those two pig, creature, beast things.
In a line.
Yeah.
Can I also catch the king or no?
-speak Matt 
No, it has to be a line.
It has to go straight.
-speak Sam 
Going for the guys.
I don't want to scald you.
You're already hurting.
I'm going to go straight across the piggies and make them squeal with Lightning.
-speak Matt 
All right.
At the start of your turn–
-speak Sam 
Oh shit, there's a trap.
-speak Matt 
No, at the start of your turn you come up and the creature looks over and you guys make eye contact.
You weren't averting your gaze.
Go ahead and make a constitution save.
-speak Liam 
Saving throw, saving throw.
Come on, Scanlan, you lucky motherfucker!
Roll high.
-speak Sam 
17, plus what?
-speak Matt 
Plus your constitution modifier.
-speak Sam 
19.
-speak Matt 
All right, so, as it glances over at you, there's a shine in its eye, and you feel all of a sudden your form, for a second, tense, and you shrug off the effect, untouched by it.
Now, go ahead and take your turn.
-speak Sam 
I cast Lightning on the two beasts.
In a straight line.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so you pull back and you unleash a lightning bolt.
It goes streaking across the room.
-speak Sam 
If I can get the king, I'll try.
-speak Matt 
Unfortunately, he's just out of the line array, but it does streak across and blast both of these now visibly basilisks in front of you.
You hit automatically.
Just go ahead and roll damage.
(laughter)

-speak Marisha 
Oh sweet, sweet dice rolls.
-speak Liam 
Let it rain!
-speak Marisha 
Let it rain d6s from the sky!
-speak Sam 
29.
-speak Matt 
29.
One fails its saving throw, one makes it.
So 29 damage to one, and 14 to the other.
-speak Sam 
And then, for bonus action, I inspire Vax with a little ditty.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Sam 
(sings) I want to sing a song of inspiration, of inspiration!
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
All righty, that's it.
That ends Scanlan's turn.
King Murghol's turn, now.
King Murghol is going to– It sees this blast of lightning streak past now, as it blasts, just barely passing in front of it, hitting both of his pet basilisks.
Now seeing that there's, like, a full army between himself and the current intruders, one of which is visibly stiffening, he glances over at this tiny gnome individual, who now gave loose to this bolt of energy.
Grabs his blade with both hands and goes running towards you with an angry– but he uses a bonus action, quickly, to pull out a vial, pop a cork, chug it, shatter the glass on the ground.
As he does, you can see his arms actually billow and grow extremely strong and thick with muscle.
MARISHA and LAURA: What color was the vial?
-speak Matt 
This was purplish in color.
He then runs forward.
And is going to take his turn, swinging at Scanlan.
-speak Sam 
As he does, I sing (sings) Dodge that sexy attack-oh white boy.
(laughter)

-speak Sam 
I sing my– what is it called?
Counter– Cutting Word– no, yes, what?
Cutting Words!
And I try to distract him as he's attacking me.
What is that, a d8?
-speak Matt 
A d8 off of his first attack.
-speak Sam 
Five.
-speak Matt 
Five.
Okay, well, he rolled a 20, which brings it down, oh, a total of 20, which brings it down to 15.
What's your armor class?
-speak Sam 
14.
-speak Matt 
Oh.
Second strike is a 13.
Third strike is a 12.
Wow, he just can't hit at all this turn.
But, however, the one strike he does get on you, the sword comes down, streaks across the front of you, and as you're finishing your last, final note of that song, you take 18 points of slashing damage.
-speak Sam 
Okay, okay, okay.
-speak Ashley 
Where you at?
-speak Sam 
I'm fine.
-speak Ashley 
Where are you at?
-speak Sam 
I'm fine.
I've got more than him.
-speak Matt 
That ends his turn.
This brings us back to Vex!
-speak Laura 
That's me!
I cast Hunter's Mark!
Actually, I just transfer it, because the other one died.
I transfer it to the king.
And then I cast– First I want to move Trinket over and– oh no, I can only move Trinket.
Okay, first I'm gonna cast Conjure Barrage.
It's a 60-foot cone.
So I want to see how many of them I can get.
-speak Matt 
You can, you can get– let's see.
That'll get everybody.
-speak Laura 
Can I angle it so I don't hit my buddies?
-speak Matt 
You can angle it in a way that will– well, if you wanna get the king in it, you're going to hit these two here.
And Grog.
-speak Laura 
All right, I'll hit them.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so, you will be able to hit everything in that row.
So go for it.
How does the effect on that work?
-speak Laura 
I roll 3d8.
-speak Matt 
All right, so go ahead and roll 3d8.
-speak Laura 
That was on a corner.
Oh good!
17.
-speak Matt 
17, okay.
And what's the effect on the spell, like what do they roll against?
-speak Laura 
They roll a dexterity saving throw.
-speak Matt 
Dexterity saving throw.
King makes his, with a 20.
So he takes half-damage for it, or no damage?
-speak Laura 
Half as much, yeah.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so what was the total again?
It was– What was the total originally?
It was– what was the total?
-speak Laura 
The total?
Was 17.
-speak Matt 
17.
Okay, so that is eight damage to the king.
-speak Laura 
Plus a Hunter's Mark.
-speak Matt 
Right, so roll the additional one on that.
-speak Laura 
Four.
-speak Matt 
Four, gotcha.
All right.
The basilisk also does not make its save.
What's the DC on this?
-speak Laura 
DC.
What do you mean?
-speak Matt 
Your spell DC.
At the top of your spell page.
-speak Laura 
Yes.
It's 14.
-speak Matt 
14.
-speak Laura 
Oh, I did get a– I didn't add my spell attack bonus!
Should I have done that?
-speak Matt 
No, that's just to hit something with a spell.
-speak Laura 
Okay, cool.
-speak Matt 
All right, so basilisk in front makes it, so it takes the eight damage.
Okay, the rest of the duergar, they do make their saves, they take half damage.
However, with the spray of arrows that comes flying out of the front of your bow, you manage to take out five duergar in one swipe.
The others ones remain, damaged but still standing.
Also, now dexterity saving throw for you, Tiberius, and Grog.
-speak Marisha 
Natural 20.
-speak Orion 
19.
-speak Matt 
Nice.
So both you guys take eight damage.
Grog fails, Grog takes 17.
-speak Laura 
I'm sorry, Grog.
-speak Matt 
It's all right.
-speak Laura 
Oh, I move Trinket in, and I want to– If I can get him to illithid, I want to get Trinket close, like kind of behind the queen.
No, no, I want to get him near.
That way he can flank.
-speak Matt 
Okay, all right.
That ends your turn.
It is now Lady Kima's turn.
-speak Sam 
Ooh, I forgot about her.
-speak Matt 
Kima rushes in angrily.
She has to make a saving throw.
Succeeds against the basilisk, as it glances past.
Rushes forward, in combat with both King Murghol and the basilisk.
However, as she goes in for King Murghol, screaming, the blade of the greatsword arcing across the air with a divine glowing energy, you see it aiming for the king, but then looks to her side and sees this dangerous lizard creature, recognizing it in a moment, she changes her trajectory and swings next to the lizard with her first strike.
That is a– that hits.
And that strike does just enough damage.
She cleaves that basilisk in two with her first strike.
With her first strike, using the inertia, she turns around and strikes at King Murghol.
However, King Murghol, seeing her come forward, takes his sword up and manages to parry hers to the side.
Both of them lock for a second as he steps into her and kind of glares into her face.
-speak Matt 
Oh, you're supposed to be downstairs for playtime.
-speak Matt 
Pushes her off with his blade.
-speak Marisha 
Playtime?
I don't– (laughs) I know, all the ladies are like 'ew'.
-speak Matt 
That brings us to Queen Ulara's turn.
Queen Ulara is now standing over there with Trinket towards her back.
As she instinctually does this, she goes ahead and reaches up, places her hand on the front of her robes.
You can see this duergar woman with kind of long, reddish hair that she's let flow to the back, to the small of her back.
She stands up out of the throne.
As she puts her hand on her chest, her form shimmers, much like you saw earlier on Tiberius, in your earlier battle.
She moves back to there.
-speak Orion 
As she does that, I try to Counterspell it.
-speak Matt 
That's a reaction?
-speak Orion 
Yep.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
So let's go ahead and do the contested roll.
-speak Orion 
Contested roll.
-speak Sam 
That was almost the name of this show.
Not as catchy.
-speak Orion 
DC equals ten plus the spell's level.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
So the DC is 12.
Go ahead and you roll that.
-speak Orion 
DC is 13.
It's a third-level spell.
Right?
-speak Matt 
Blur is second-level.
-speak Orion 
Oh, I thought Counter– Okay, I see.
-speak Matt 
Yes.
So, Counterspell.
Go ahead and– Oh– interrupt a creature in process of casting a spell.
If the creature is casting a spell– third level or lower, it fails and has no effect.
So, yeah, it just counters it entirely.
So, the– her form begins to shimmer for a second.
All of a sudden, Tiberius, your attempt to go ahead and counter the spell, that burst of energy you're trying to put through the Blur vanishes.
She looks back at you.
-speak Orion 
What do you think you're doing, lass?
-speak Sam 
You still trying to be a god?
-speak Orion 
I'm in that form still.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Yeah.
So with her sorcery points expended on that quick cast, she turns around for her main action, puts out her fingers, and you see these blasts of blue energy begin to rocket out from her fingertips, across the room, in what is a Chain Lightning.
-speak Liam 
Shit.
He's got the iPhone out.
-speak Matt 
So, this'll be towards– actually, this'd be towards you, Vex, Kima, and Scanlan.
-speak Laura 
All right.
-speak Liam 
Did you say Vex or Vax?
-speak Matt 
Yeah, Vex and Vax, both of you.
-speak Laura 
Wait, you're all the way over there.
-speak Sam 
Yeah, you're all the way over somewhere else, right?
-speak Matt 
Over there, yeah.
Chain Lightning, man.
It's a bitch.
All right.
All right, so.
Vax, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
-speak Liam 
Not good.
Seven.
-speak Matt 
Seven, all right.
-speak Liam 
Can I use Evasion, or– Uncanny Dodge or Evasion?
-speak Sam 
I gave you some dice.
I gave you, I gave you some dice.
-speak Liam 
You did give me some dice.
-speak Sam 
It's not going to be enough, though.
-speak Liam 
So now I'm at 13, but can I use Evasion or Uncanny Dodge?
Evasion is for area effects, Uncanny Dodge is–
-speak Matt 
Well, you've already used one for the area effect, the other one reduces the damage by half.
-speak Liam 
All right, Uncanny Dodge.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so you're reducing the damage by half?
-speak Liam 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so instead, you take 18 points of lightning damage.
However, both Vex and Scanlan and Kima all have to make dexterity saving throws as well.
She makes hers.
-speak Sam 
Not great.
14.
I have no dexterity.
-speak Laura 
16.
-speak Matt 
16, okay.
So you took, was it 18 lightning damage, I said?
-speak Liam 
Oh, I didn't add any dexterity.
I add a nine to what I got, which means I'm at 22.
-speak Matt 
Just, you mean, your dexterity modifier?
22?
Okay, then you would've taken half damage, make it quarter damage, so you take half of that even.
So keep that in mind when you make your dexterity saving throw.
So, that would give you total how much damage?
So, it was 18 you took, right?
-speak Liam 
Yeah, and we halved it to nine.
Five?
-speak Matt 
So, 36 damage to Scanlan and to Kima, and to you, Vex.
36 points of lightning damage.
That ends her turn.
Tiberius, you're up.
So you, it's your turn now, as you're now on top of the scorpion still.
-speak Ashley 
It's okay.
-speak Marisha 
You're on top of me.
I'm holding you!
-speak Ashley 
I got you.
-speak Orion 
Cool.
This is– there's still on the altar that's raised above– and all that.
-speak Taliesin 
You've got a problem down there, to be fair.
-speak Orion 
Where we're at?
-speak Taliesin 
You've got the witch problem to deal with.
-speak Matt 
What do you got, Tiberius?
Quick, before you miss your turn.
-speak Orion 
I shall miss nothing.
I'm going to stay right where I'm at.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Orion 
I'm going to snicker, and I will (laughs) hand out, put out my hand, and give my little ring a rub, and let out a Fireball from it, right where no one else but these buttholes will get hurt.
-speak Matt 
All right, so (laughs), I'd say probably a 20-foot radius around would put it about there.
-speak Liam 
(Tiberius voice) What is the Common word for it?
-speak All 
(Tiberius voice) Butthole.
-speak Matt 
So, as you polish off the ring and release it, the bead of red energy streaks across, blasting the floor, the secondary explosion, giant Fireball just bursts into the room, go ahead and roll damage on that.
-speak Orion 
Six, I have enough, there's a four, this is terrible, help me count, eight.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, well, we have all these twos.
Let's put the twos side by side.
That's fun.
Uh-huh.
-speak Laura 
Your turns are taking so long!
-speak Orion 
18.
23!
-speak Matt 
23.
Okay.
The rest of these duergar detonate, blasted away out of play.
Just, their bodies go thrown against the walls and the various pillars in the room.
There's two pillars over there, they're kind of holding the ceiling up.
The rest of them just go thrown about the room.
The queen takes a bit of the damage, but seems to shrug off most of it.
-speak Orion 
I'm going to spend two sorcerer points.
And I'm going to reach out my hand, and I'm going to form an ice knife and– where is the queen, actually?
-speak Matt 
Right there.
-speak Orion 
Oh, very good.
I'm going to throw the ice knife right there.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
Right there?
All right.
-speak Orion 
And I cast it at level two.
-speak Matt 
All right.
So you get to throw at a target, though, right?
Or are you just throwing on the ground to do the radial?
Okay, so you take– you form the ice knife, you throw it, it streaks across, slams into the stone floor and explodes, sending shards of ice out.
Go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Orion 
Which is 3d6, because it's at level two now.
-speak Matt 
Correct.
Saving throw, which it succeeds.
-speak Orion 
Much better.
14 points of damage.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
Both succeed for half damage.
So seven points of damage to each.
All right, got it, cool.
That ends your turn, Tiberius.
Clarota, now–
-speak Orion 
How do you like them apples?
!
-speak Matt 
Clarota steps forward– Seeing the other mind flayer there, steps past and decides to go into a contest of wills against it.
-speak Marisha 
Contest of wills, staring contest, staring contest!
-speak Matt 
All right, this is intense.
All right.
Clarota is going to step forward and begin to intensely stare at– you can see the air itself seems to shimmer and push, like a strange bubble shifting between the two of them at this connection point.
Mind flayer, now one-eyed and seeping liquid from the side of its face, glares back at him.
Fails his saving throw.
-speak Marisha 
That's right, he does.
-speak Matt 
This mind flayer suddenly diverts its attention away from Clarota and towards the queen.
(cheering)

-speak Sam 
The old Dominate.
-speak Ashley 
Tight, tight, tight.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
That ends Clarota's turn.
All right.
The duergar would go if they weren't all blasted to hell.
That brings us to Keyleth.
-speak Marisha 
All right.
I'm going to go right for the king.
You're coming for a ride, Tiberius.
I'm gonna make a straight line.
I have a 40-foot movement, pretty straight movement.
-speak Orion 
All right!
Let's get 'em!
-speak Laura 
Oh no, Tiberius fell off.
-speak Matt 
There you go.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, I'm in melee, yeah?
-speak Matt 
Yes, you are.
-speak Marisha 
All right, I'm gonna do my full three multi-attack.
-speak Orion 
I'm maniacally laughing.
-speak Matt 
You are going to have a disadvantage on the tail attack, because you have Tiberius on your back and you're trying to make sure you don't hit him with your tail.
-speak Marisha 
Okay.
-speak Matt 
So, first two claw strikes.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, first one, probably not gonna hit.
12?
-speak Matt 
No, that does not hit.
-speak Marisha 
Second one.
16?
-speak Matt 
Does not hit.
Clink, clink!
Off the armor.
Tail strike.
-speak Marisha 
Tail strike.
Two.
Ten.
Nothing.
-speak Matt 
Yeah, unfortunately just his thick suit of armor– you're just hitting at him with the giant scorpion claws, but nothing seems to be getting through.
-speak Marisha 
God, you're so heavy, Tiberius, god!
-speak Matt 
You hear this clacking scorpion angrily (scorpion sounds).
-speak Marisha 
My balance is wonky.
-speak Matt 
Pike, you're up!
-speak Ashley 
All right, time for some healing.
So pull me in there.
I'm gonna do a– I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds.
At level five gives, which I thinks gives– thinks?
Which methinks gives me 4d8?
Plus my spell ability modifier.
Okay, so–
-speak Marisha 
Get your heal on.
-speak Liam 
(Yoda voice) 4d8 you would give.
-speak Ashley 
Oh, so, 20.
20 points of healing for whoever would like it.
-speak Matt 
For everyone who's in the radius.
Everyone but Grog, essentially, gets healed for 20 points.
Grog's too far away from you, unfortunately.
-speak Sam 
Thank you, my love.
-speak Matt 
All right, Percy, you're up.
-speak Taliesin 
All right, I'm going to just get– just step into the doorway to take a look.
I'm just stepping one step.
And now I'm just going to shoot– can I– I'm just gonna try and– The minute I recognize what a basilisk is, since I've faced them before, I'm going to do my best not to look and take a shot.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so go ahead and fire with a disadvantage against the basilisk on the far end of the room.
-speak Sam 
Don't you shoot me.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, that was a pretty one.
-speak Taliesin 
I get 16 at my disadvantage.
-speak Matt 
16 at disadvantage?
That does hit.
Go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Taliesin 
Nice!
I'll be taking another shot, too.
-speak Matt 
Also, Tiberius, make another constitution saving throw.
-speak Taliesin 
Six points of damage.
-speak Matt 
Six points of damage to the basilisk, got it.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to take another shot, though.
16 again.
-speak Orion 
Ten.
-speak Taliesin 
16 hits.
This time I do 12 points of damage.
-speak Marisha 
12 points?
-speak Taliesin 
12 points.
And then I'm gonna duck back around the corner again.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
Cool.
As you duck around the corner, you've gotten these strikes in, and as you're trying to– as you finish your blows on the duergar king, Murghol, in front of you, you hear this clanking sound as Tiberius's now fully stone form falls off of the scorpion onto the ground, beside you.
-speak Sam 
Oh no!
He's stoned!
-speak Ashley 
You turned to stone?
-speak Laura 
'Cause of the basilisk.
-speak Liam 
We've dealt with this before.
-speak Laura 
Basilisk blood, we can fix it.
-speak Sam 
I think you pee on the body and it cures them.
-speak Ashley 
Can I– I can't, I have to go–
-speak Sam 
Let's try it and find out.
-speak Matt 
The basilisk now takes its turn.
-speak Liam 
(stone Tiberius voice) Please, no!
-speak Matt 
Steps forward onto the edge.
It's going to go ahead and– it's gonna be for Lady Kima.
It's going to attempt to make its stare at her.
Lady Kima–
-speak Ashley 
Close your eyes!
-speak Laura 
She's smart, she's closing her eyes.
-speak Matt 
Lady Kima, who's currently in this blood frenzy against the king, unfortunately is not paying attention.
Off to the side, the basilisk gets a glance out, which she looks at from the corner of her eye, she sees the movement over and has a hard time pushing through the stiffness as the gaze begins to take a clenching effect on her body.
-speak Laura 
Oh no.
COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: All set, let's go.
-speak Matt 
Yes, thank you.
Let's do that.
Oh, Waze.
Why's my phone on?
All right, so, that brings us to the– Oof, okay.
-speak Liam 
(computer voice) I'm sorry, I can't help you with that, Vex'ahlia.
-speak Matt 
This mind flayer, who's currently Dominated, steps forward and is going to attempt to make a tentacle grab against the queen.
Queen Ulara manages to dodge out of the way, seeing this coming, and just backhands it, while taking a step back.
Unfortunately does not cling with the tentacle.
That ends its action.
Yeah, unfortunately that didn't hit.
All right, next, at the top, that brings us to Vax.
-speak Liam 
I'm hasted.
I'm gonna try to go stealth again from where I am.
So I'm stealth, 17– 30.
Okay.
I'm going to scuttle along the floor and leap on the back of the basilisk and try to stab it in the eye while looking at the ceiling.
-speak Matt 
Well, at the start of your turn, it's within 30 feet of you and you can see it.
Are you going to–
-speak Liam 
Not look at it, no, no.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so you're taking disadvantage on this attack.
So you move behind, you're hidden.
-speak Liam 
15 for my first attack.
-speak Matt 
Your first attack, that will not hit, unfortunately.
-speak Liam 
And second time, 19 for the second attack.
-speak Matt 
That does hit, yes.
-speak Liam 
Okay.
Feel for the eyes, stab it with keen dagger– Four.
11.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
As you rush over, you take your first strike at the basilisk, you see it reel back and slap around its tail.
You barely just get out of the way, and as you see its head turning around to attempt to glare at you, you instinctively take your offhand dagger and place it directly into the eye socket of the basilisk.
It sinks past your fingers and you feel that warm rush of blood and gore against your hand.
As you pull back, it just slumps to the ground.
(cheering)

-speak Ashley 
We'll get you some of that– we'll get you some of that blood.
Blood!
Basilisk blood!
-speak Liam 
I only moved ten feet.
So who's stone right now?
Tiberius and– wasn't– aren't two people?
-speak Matt 
Lady Kima is mid-effect and Tiberius is solid stone.
-speak Liam 
I've got Haste on– If I've got Haste on, can I get to Kima?
'Cause I've got haste boots.
-speak Matt 
I would say, yeah, you could spend the rest of your movement doing that, yeah.
-speak Liam 
Okay, and I use my thumb to slide some of its blood off the blade and drip it onto her eyes.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
All right.
That ends your turn.
That brings us to Grog.
Grog turns and is going to go ahead and go raging, frenzied, against the queen.
And a critical hit.
(cheering)

-speak Marisha 
He crit?
-speak Orion 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
The first hit, she's gonna go ahead and use her reaction to do Shield, it's going to up her defense.
First attack misses, so two attacks miss now and the last attack is a critical hit, which is nice.
So that's a–
-speak Marisha 
No crits for you!
Crit happens, whether you're here or not.
-speak Matt 
All right, so that's 31 points of damage.
Oof, that's a hefty chunk.
All right, that ends Grog's turn.
That brings us to Scanlan!
-speak Sam 
I'm next to the king, right?
I'm near the king?
Over there.
-speak Matt 
Yep.
You're right next to him.
-speak Sam 
Okay.
I just make eye contact with him and I mentally tell him that he really has the urge to try to do a headstand.
Lay down his weapon and he really just wants to see if he can do it.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Sam 
Suggestion.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
(laughs) What's your DC?
-speak Sam 
19.
-speak Matt 
All right.
This is through the hand cone?
-speak Sam 
Through the hand cone, through the hand cone.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
That will be a 20, unfortunately.
Makes his saving throw.
He glances back towards you with a look of confusion for a second.
Looks at his feet and like begins to reach forward and then steels his mind and looks up at you angrily.
All right.
-speak Sam 
Can I also, as my bonus action– Who's around me?
Who needs inspiration?
Who needs inspiring?
Who's– yeah, oh, shit.
I'll give Pike some inspiration, 'cause she's my awesome sweetheart.
-speak Ashley 
What do I get?
-speak Laura 
You get 1d8.
-speak Ashley 
Hey, thanks, man.
-speak Matt 
Next up is King Murghol, who's furious now.
Both of his beasts have been slain and most of his men have been completely torn asunder by multitudes of arrows and fireball spells.
He, now growing in physical form, on top of already the musculature he acquired from that potion, is going to make his three attacks against whatever is nearby.
That's actually going to be– actually, that's gonna be two strikes against you, Scanlan, since you just now tried to make him stand on his head, and one against Kima.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
That is a 15–
-speak Sam 
Hit.
-speak Matt 
– a 24–
-speak Sam 
(higher voice) Hit.
-speak Matt 
– and against Kima is a 20, that also hits.
So all three hit.
-speak Liam 
Nobody puts baby in the corner.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Oof, all right.
So the first strike hits you for 21 points of slashing damage.
-speak Sam 
Still alive.
-speak Matt 
The next one hits you for 23 points of slashing damage.
-speak Sam 
No longer alive (laughs).
-speak Ashley 
You're no longer alive?
-speak Laura 
Are you unconscious?
!
-speak Matt 
Scanlan falls unconscious on the ground from the two strikes of the king.
The third strike back towards Kima, who's currently seizing from the effect of the spell.
She's restrained, so he has advantage.
-speak Liam 
But she's got the basilisk blood in her eyes.
-speak Matt 
There's a process to undoing a creature into stone.
To your knowledge, it does not seem to be having an effect.
However, Lady Kima takes 22 points of damage.
All righty.
That brings us to– Vex, you're up.
-speak Laura 
Oh, that's me.
Every time!
-speak Liam 
I'm Vex.
-speak Laura 
No, you're not.
Okay, I'm gonna hail, I'm gonna– hail of arr– no, yeah, Hail of Thorns?
At level three.
-speak Matt 
Okay, at who?
-speak Laura 
At the queen and the illithid.
So, I should've transferred my bonus action over to– but I didn't, that's okay.
That gives me– I should've done this before, I'm an asshole, I'm sorry.
-speak Liam 
But what about in the game?
-speak Laura 
That gives me 2d10.
-speak Matt 
Additional damage to the arrow.
-speak Laura 
Yes.
-speak Matt 
So it explodes around, right?
All right, so, fire the arrow.
So, as your bonus action, you go and you grab one of the arrows out from the back, and as you pull it back you can see a bunch of these little thorns begin to grow and sprout from the actual shaft of the arrow.
You release it and as it arcs across–
-speak Laura 
Yes!
Natural 20!
(cheering)

-speak Matt 
Against the queen.
All right, go ahead and roll the damage for the arrow and the damage for the spell.
And all that doubles.
-speak Laura 
Oh, awesome.
-speak Marisha 
(sings) All that doubles is gold.
-speak Taliesin 
(sings) Only shooting arrows.
-speak Orion 
(sings) In a butthole.
-speak Laura 
Yeah, all of it doubles.
-speak Matt 
The bonus at the end doesn't double, just the dice.
-speak Laura 
Oh, so, 36–
-speak Matt 
36 points of damage.
Yeah, plus the seven.
And then it does– it explodes?
In a radius.
And it does the dice damage, the 2d10, to–
-speak Laura 
To everything within five feet.
-speak Matt 
All right, so the mind flayer and Grog.
-speak Laura 
Oh, right, yeah, I should've hit the mind flayer with that arrow.
No, it would've still hit Grog.
Okay.
-speak Liam 
Grog is a tank.
-speak Laura 
They have to make a dexterity saving throw.
-speak Matt 
All righty.
Grog does not make it and the mind flayer does not make it.
-speak Laura 
Yes!
-speak Matt 
All right, cool.
All right, second arrow you can fire now if you want to.
-speak Laura 
Second arrow.
I'm gonna fire from my flaming bow.
I've got one shot on that left.
At her again.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Laura 
And that's a 28.
-speak Matt 
That hits.
-speak Laura 
And that's nine plus a ten, where's my ten?
There they are.
That's plus two.
11.
-speak Matt 
All right.
You see flames begin to burn up along the side of her robe and she's looking really flustered and frustrated at this point.
All right, that brings us to Kima's turn.
No.
She's made of hardy stuff.
Kima currently is fighting this, is going to go ahead and release an entire– all of her attacks against the king Murghol as he's right in front of her.
She has disadvantage on that, unfortunately, because she is restrained.
She's gonna make two attacks against him using Divine Smite, expending a 3rd-level spell.
So that's 3d8 extra damage to each strike.
So the first one hits.
Both hit.
All right.
She's going to do it twice.
That's gonna be 6d8 additional damage.
-speak Marisha 
Ooh!
That's hot.
-speak Matt 
Oof.
Okay.
So, as Kima rears back, her first strike comes down and hits overhead, into King Murghol's armor, and as it does, it hits.
The blade only goes about a few inches in, but then all of a sudden the blade heats up white-hot and actually buries itself an additional six inches into his shoulder.
He screams out in pain, reaches up and grabs the blade and as he does, his hand actually burns in the process.
She pulls the blade out, around and swings it down again, sinking another eight inches into the side of his torso.
This time with a giant arc of white divine light into the side.
He looks like he's starting to bleed out from the two of the wounds really heavily.
The king is looking a little rough.
That ends Kima's turn.
Kima's going to try and make a saving throw.
Kima pulls the blade out, and turns to stone herself.
-speak Laura 
Oh shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
He's still at like really high health, too.
The king.
-speak Sam 
What, he is?
-speak Matt 
The king is looking a little rough.
-speak Sam 
You never know.
He might just start doing a headstand.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
The queen's turn.
-speak Laura 
Oh no.
-speak Matt 
The queen looks over at Grog in front of her, kinda frustratedly, uses a bulk of sorcery points, puts her hand up towards him as he's pulling his axe back angrily.
He fails his save.
And he puts his axe back down and looks towards the rest of the group.
-speak Marisha 
Oh no!
Not again!
-speak Matt 
Eye color glazed over.
-speak Sam 
He's so easily influenced.
-speak Laura 
No, he's under her control.
-speak Matt 
So that was her sorcery points, her quick action.
She then says, 
-speak Matt 
We're not gonna die this day alone and I won't die.
My love, I'm sorry, but there's much more work to be done.
-speak Matt 
And she raises her hand up and you see this buildup of green arcane energy at her hand.
She turns it towards the rest of the group, faces it up towards the ceiling and releases this pulse of arcane, green, ill-looking energy that blasts into the stone ceiling.
As it does, the stone itself disintegrates in a large chunk, and a glowing mass of seeping, hot, molten magma begins to pour into the room.
-speak Marisha 
Oh shit!
-speak Orion 
Where's it coming from?
-speak Matt 
It's now coming from right here.
-speak Laura 
Oh my god.
-speak Liam 
(sings) TPK.
TPK.
-speak Matt 
So now, magma is pouring onto the throne room from above.
The giant fall that is on top of the fortress is now peering into the room.
-speak Sam 
(high-pitched) Someone grab me and leave.
-speak Matt 
That brings us to Tiberius, who is stone.
Clarota currently looks around and–
-speak Orion 
Hold on.
Am I conscious in stone form?
-speak Matt 
No.
You are a slate.
You are a blue screen.
You are Grog after the intellect devourer.
-speak Ashley 
Oh god, this is bad.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
(laughs)
-speak Sam 
Pike, it's all on you, dude.
-speak Marisha 
Do you have water?
-speak Ashley 
I can create it.
-speak Matt 
Clarota steps back and grabs Lady Kima and begins dragging her back through the doorway.
-speak Laura 
Oh god, we've got to get out.
That's a retreat.
-speak Matt 
Pulling her down towards the stairway.
That brings us to Keyleth.
-speak Sam 
Keyleth.
Keyleth.
Get us out of here.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, okay, okay.
I come out of the form.
Yes, thank you.
-speak Matt 
It's a free action.
-speak Orion 
Isn't there a dead basilisk right in front of us right now?
-speak Matt 
There is a body of a dead basilisk on the ground, yes.
-speak Marisha 
I'm going to take Wind Wall.
I'm gonna cast Wind Wall and try and wrap it around the lava column and try and contain it within the Wind Wall, cooling it down.
Essentially making a tornado-like vortex around the lava.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
For the purposes of this, I want you to go ahead and make a basic religion check.
-speak Marisha 
Okay.
-speak Matt 
Wait no, not religion.
For you it'd be nature.
Just for the purposes of my thought, I think a nature check would be an interesting way to see how this plays out.
-speak Marisha 
18.
-speak Matt 
18?
Okay.
So, as you bring this gust of cold wind, swirling around, the column of magma begins to cool and darken as Trinket is like backing up against the wall and the magma is starting to singe the edge of Trinket's nails.
It cools to a dark, black, kind of rockish color.
And the magma fall ceases, but you can see parts of it breaking and beginning to break past that shell exterior.
So you've slowed it.
-speak Marisha 
This isn't gonna hold for long!
Somebody rub some blood on Tiberius, quick, and let's get the hell out of here!
I'm just holding this.
-speak Matt 
Holding it there?
Okay.
That brings us to Pike.
-speak Ashley 
There's so much to do.
I don't know if I should heal you, if I should rub blood on you or if I should go try to remove the curse from Grog.
-speak Laura 
See if you can get the curse out of Grog.
Because if we've got to retreat, then–
-speak Ashley 
Can Remove Curse remove the thing off of him?
-speak Matt 
From your knowledge, no, it's an arcane effect, not a curse.
-speak Ashley 
That's an arcane effect.
Okay, so, Grog might be on his own for a little bit.
Okay.
So can I heal Scanlan and then also rub some basilisk blood on Tiberius?
-speak Matt 
From your previous experience, it's not the blood directly.
The blood itself has to be distilled into a specific alchemical form to reverse the effect.
-speak Orion 
We just drank the blood last time.
-speak Matt 
No, it wasn't drinking.
After the battle, you guys took the blood, prepared it, and then used it as part of the recovery.
-speak Marisha 
Will someone collect some blood?
-speak Matt 
Okay, so you heal Scanlan.
How much does he heal?
-speak Orion 
The king's almost dead.
-speak Marisha 
Do we want to kill the king?
Do we need somebody alive to help us?
-speak Ashley 
Oh, 19, 19!
-speak Matt 
So you're healed 19.
You're on the ground, prone, but you're conscious now.
-speak Sam 
Hi!
-speak Matt 
You look up at Pike and smile and you look over and see this large column of magma that's now cracking through stone and pouring into the throne room again.
-speak Ashley 
Is there anything else we can do?
Is there anything else I can do at this moment?
-speak Matt 
No, this has been a heal, this has been– no, okay, you can move, that's about it.
-speak Ashley 
I can move?
Can I take anyone with me while I move?
-speak Matt 
I will say you can drag him.
You'll be at half speed.
-speak Ashley 
Can I try to drag Tiberius away from the magma?
-speak Matt 
You can try.
Make a strength check.
-speak Sam 
You're two feet tall.
He's a dragon.
-speak Matt 
Let's say athletics, do athletics.
-speak Ashley 
Athletics?
19.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
So, you grab onto Tiberius, you rush over after healing him, grab and start dragging him towards the entrance.
At half-speed you manage to get him three squares, that's as far as you got.
As you're pulling back, the king, as a reaction, gets one strike on you with his sword.
That's gonna be a 19.
-speak Ashley 
Get outta here.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Your AC is 20?
-speak Ashley 
It's 20.
-speak Matt 
So the blade hits you–
-speak Ashley 
I just flip him off.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
The blade comes down towards you, but with a flash of divine energy in your shoulder armor, it just gets deflected off the side and you glare at him out of the side of your face.
And continue to drag Tiberius out of the room.
-speak Liam 
Now go home and get your shine box.
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
All right.
Percy, you're up.
-speak Taliesin 
All right.
I'm going to step into the room, to give some cover.
Right about, probably just slightly on the other end of this.
-speak Matt 
Where, over here?
-speak Taliesin 
No, like, next to Keyleth, like near Keyleth.
-speak Matt 
Oh, you're gonna have to go around here, then.
This is a really harrowing place.
-speak Taliesin 
Okay, the first thing I'm going to do, is I'm going to– I've got my ice shot loaded.
I'm going to take a shot at the break in the ceiling and I'm gonna try and ice it over.
-speak Matt 
Okay, all right.
So as you pull over, you go ahead and aim up with your ice shot ready.
Go ahead and fire.
-speak Taliesin 
That's 20.
-speak Matt 
20 definitively hits.
It's not hard to do.
Go ahead and roll damage and that will signify how long and how much it will stop.
So just the ice damage.
Not the actual bullet, it won't do anything.
So just–
-speak Taliesin 
Oh.
So just the ice damage
-speak Matt 
Just the ice damage.
-speak Taliesin 
Two.
-speak Matt 
Two.
Okay.
So as you blast up, you can see, as the magma's beginning to pour down again, you blast it and it immediately– a spot cools into a rock and begins to slip again.
You've maybe given yourself a couple more seconds.
That may be what you need, you don't know.
But that's all you got on that one.
-speak Taliesin 
Okay, my next shot, I'm just gonna turn to the king and just shoot.
-speak Matt 
Okay, go for it.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm also gonna spend a point for additional damage.
And I'm also taking Sharpshooter for additional damage.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Taliesin 
That's 16.
-speak Matt 
16 versus armor class will not hit, unfortunately.
-speak Taliesin 
Oh!
Wait, okay, no, I just, I don't get the– oh god, it's not Pathfinder, gah!
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
-speak Taliesin 
Okay, that's fine.
I'm gonna spend my bonus action to take another shot.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so you're using your Action Surge?
-speak Taliesin 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
So Action Surge.
You now have two more attacks.
Go for it.
-speak Taliesin 
23, eff you.
-speak Matt 
That hits.
(laughter)

-speak Taliesin 
That's nine points of damage.
-speak Matt 
Nine points of damage, got it.
-speak Taliesin 
Taking another shot.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Taliesin 
This shot's fire, fire bonus damage.
And I'm also gonna spend another grit point to maybe do a little more damage.
28 to hit.
-speak Matt 
That hits.
Go ahead and roll damage.
With the extra grit point you do two dice, right?
-speak Taliesin 
Yeah.
I get a bonus die, I just have to find one.
Oh, that'll do.
That's 17 points of damage plus one point of fire damage.
-speak Matt 
Nice.
Okay, so, the next– the first shot fires, just ricochets off his armor and streaks across the room.
You get his attention, though, and he looks back at you with this kind of wild look in his eyes, the muscles tensing.
You can see the armor actually bending and twisting against his physical form underneath.
However, the next shot blasts off side of his jaw, there's actually a giant gap now in his flesh as he looks back at you and you can see his teeth.
And as he grits down towards you, now definitely intent on getting vengeance on that, the second shot (impact sound) takes off a chunk of his head.
You can see the skull exposed on where you've now taken a piece of flesh off the top of his scalp.
He's looking pretty rough.
-speak Taliesin 
Let's move it, people.
And I'm gonna take like a step back towards the door.
Just with what's remaining of my movement.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
You can get back to there.
All right.
That brings us to–
-speak Taliesin 
Oh, I killed him, didn't I?
No, he's not dead, damn it.
-speak Matt 
He's not dead yet.
Not dead yet.
-speak Taliesin 
I know, that would've been so cool.
-speak Matt 
All right.
The mind flayer, who is no longer dominated as Clarota took his attention off of that for the time being, looks around at everyone, sees the circumstance, the magma flowing down, and just grabs his chest and you can see his form blink out and vanish.
-speak Orion 
(groans) He peaced out.
-speak Matt 
That brings us to the top.
Vax.
At this round, by the way, is broken and has begun to spread, the magma has now filled this much of the room.
And it's quickening.
-speak Liam 
My boots of haste are on, so I run– I just dart right around Grog, around that column, up to the queen, while pulling out my keen dagger, I speak my mother's name, kiss the blade and shove it in, right into her collarbone.
-speak Matt 
All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
-speak Liam 
So that's a two, but I'm gonna use Luck.
I get ad– 20.
-speak Matt 
20 does hit.
-speak Liam 
Because of it, and because Grog's there, this–
-speak Matt 
Grog is not an ally, currently.
You do not get Sneak Attack.
-speak Liam 
Don't get Sneak Attack, all right.
Three, ten, then.
That's the first attack.
And the second one also hits, that's a 29.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Liam 
Is ten.
-speak Matt 
Ten, nice.
So the first blade plunges into her clavicle, she maneuvers out of the way to the point where it misses any vital points, but still sinks in.
She looks at you angrily and you can see her dull white, ashy, duergar eyes flash with an intense arcane rage.
As you pull the blade out, her eyes dart around with some sort of a plan, a thought process going through her head, as the other blade sinks into the side of her torso she spits out blood that actually spatters across your face.
She pushes the blade out and you see her preparing herself for something.
That ends your turn.
Grog currently moves forward towards you.
-speak Liam 
(Grog voice) Wrong direction!
-speak Matt 
That is a 25 versus armor class.
-speak Liam 
Yeah, but Uncanny Dodge!
-speak Matt 
How many times can you– you've already used that.
It's once per encounter.
Once per encounter you can use that.
Next one is a 21 versus armor class?
-speak Liam 
Once a round.
-speak Matt 
Once a round you can do it?
Okay, well never mind.
So take half on that first attack.
All right, so.
First strike comes at you with a– oof, that'll be 19 points of damage.
Reduced to nine.
-speak Liam 
Yeah, okay.
-speak Matt 
Second strike hits you for a total of 15 points of damage.
So 24 total.
-speak Marisha 
Could be worse.
-speak Matt 
And that's Grog's go.
That brings us to Scanlan.
-speak Liam 
That really hurts, Grog.
-speak Sam 
With my knowledge of the arcane arts, do I have any knowledge that using my Dispel Magic spell would work on Grog?
Or do I just have to try it?
-speak Matt 
It's a possibility.
You know the spell that's been cast on him– you use it.
There is a chance, but it has to be a contested roll.
-speak Liam 
You could roll a 20.
-speak Marisha 
You could roll a 20.
-speak Sam 
Does it take my move to just stand up?
-speak Matt 
Yes, it does, unfortunately.
So it's your call.
-speak Sam 
But I don't have to be standing to cast a spell–
-speak Matt 
No, but I would say it's going to be difficult, it's going to give–
-speak Sam 
All right, I'll stand up.
-speak Matt 
All right.
You get back up.
What are you doing?
-speak Sam 
And I will– Jesus, is it better for me to get out of there or get the king?
-speak Laura 
Yeah, get the king.
You may be able to kill him.
He's on his last legs, probably.
-speak Matt 
He's looking pretty rough.
-speak Sam 
Yeah, but Keyleth is right behind him.
-speak Liam 
Do it.
Stab him.
-speak Laura 
You can attack him with your sword.
-speak Sam 
I am a tiny, tiny boy.
I can only do–
-speak Laura 
Do it anyway.
He's at his last legs.
It would be epic, Scanlan.
-speak Matt 
What do you got?
Go ahead, quick.
Magma's pouring through.
-speak Sam 
Okay, I swing my Singing Dawnblade at him.
(laughs) I have a dawn blade.
It's just so lame though!
It's so weak!
-speak Matt 
Okay, so.
Go ahead and roll for an attack, d20.
-speak Sam 
A natural 20.
(cheering)

-speak Marisha 
We said he could roll a 20!
We called it!
Who called it?
We called it.
-speak Matt 
So, roll the dice.
-speak Sam 
So that's eight.
-speak Matt 
You rolled an eight.
Times two, that's 16, plus whatever the bonus damage is for the sword.
-speak Sam 
Plus seven.
Plus the dawn blade gets another bonus attack at disadvantage.
-speak Matt 
It does.
So, you strike with a critical hit, doing– let's see, that's eight, 16, plus seven, 23 points of damage, go ahead and roll for a second attack.
-speak Sam 
I've never hit anyone with a sword before!
Five.
-speak Ashley 
Can I give him a War God's Blessing and give him a plus ten?
-speak Matt 
You can.
-speak Ashley 
All right, plus ten, so fifteen.
-speak Matt 
So what's your total?
You rolled a five, plus–
-speak Sam 
Five plus– ten– I don't know, what am I adding?
I've never used a sword before!
-speak Matt 
Add your proficiency modifier, which is four, plus your strength modifier, so that's five to that, which is ten, makes it 20, which hits!
Roll damage on the attack.
(cheering)

-speak Marisha 
Kill him, kill him!
-speak Sam 
Six!
-speak Matt 
Six points of damage.
All right, six on that plus your strength, which is one.
Seven.
Plus the dawn blade, which is– that's eight.
So that's eight damage on top of the 23.
How do you want to do this?
(cheering)

-speak Sam 
I– as I draw back the blade, I say, oh!
You should've stood on your head!
And I lop it off.
-speak Matt 
So.
As you say that, you– the blade vibrates to the sound of your voice, like the echoing of a song of Scanlan behind yours in almost a chorus out of nowhere.
The blade streaks through the air, coming down, slitting across the back of his Achilles' tendon.
He instinctually falls to one knee, which is kind of the height level for you.
As you do, you bring the blade around with a flourish and take Murghol's head off his shoulders.
It spins, tumbles to the ground, and rolls across the floor into the magma.
Blackened beard curling back as the rest of his face is melted away by the lava, which is now pouring pretty heavily into this room.
-speak Sam 
(sings) Scanlan make you feel good!
-speak Matt 
All right.
So that's your action.
And your movement.
And your bonus action.
No, you did your bonus action to do the extra attack.
-speak Sam 
Oh!
Great, great.
I don't know how to use swords!
-speak Matt 
All right, so.
That's the end of your turn.
Wow!
You used a sword!
And got a kill!
On a boss!
-speak Sam 
Yay!
-speak Ashley 
Good job, Scanlan!
-speak Matt 
All right, King Murghol's turn would be now, but he's on the ground.
Vex?
-speak Laura 
I call Trinket back.
Get him away from that lava.
I run past, 'cause I can't– can I see?
Do I have an angle or is it being blocked by molten tornado?
-speak Matt 
You– it's completely blocked right now.
-speak Laura 
Can I run across behind it?
-speak Matt 
Through here?
-speak Laura 
Yeah.
Is that magmous right now?
-speak Matt 
Yeah, it is.
It's still pouring!
She slowed it down, but it's still breaking through and pouring out slower.
It would be even bigger if they hadn't slowed it.
-speak Laura 
Okay, then well, maybe I won't run in that direction.
I run in the other direction and down– yeah.
So I can see.
-speak Matt 
Go for it.
Roll for an attack.
-speak Laura 
Okay.
-speak Matt 
First attack.
-speak Laura 
First attack is (sings) 20.
No.
19.
-speak Matt 
Hits.
-speak Laura 
Yes!
Okay.
14.
-speak Matt 
14 points of damage.
-speak Laura 
Second attack is– Second attack is (sings) 21!
-speak Matt 
Hits.
Roll damage on that.
-speak Laura 
What's that?
12?
-speak Matt 
12 to hit?
-speak Laura 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
Or 12 damage?
-speak Laura 
12 damage.
-speak Matt 
All right, 12 damage.
-speak Laura 
Oh, um.
Hunter's Mark.
Damn it.
Bonus action!
-speak Matt 
Yep.
All right, so both arrows (impact sounds).
One clips her in the leg, and the other embeds itself in her abdomen.
You see she grabs for it.
She's looking really rough.
Next is Kima.
Kima's stone.
It's now the queen's turn.
She looks over at you who's stabbed her, the arrows in her abdomen, and she looks up at Grog and says, (sighs) 
-speak Matt 
We've got business elsewhere.
-speak Matt 
And she reaches out and touches Grog.
Both of them blink out, Dimension Door.
-speak Sam 
We've lost Grog again!
-speak Matt 
A very familiar purplish color as you've seen you cast it, they Dimension Door out of the entire vicinity.
-speak Sam 
Son of a–
-speak Marisha 
This is the second time we've lost Grog.
-speak Matt 
At which point, the stone rocks crack on the column and the magma now goes into full pour.
-speak Laura 
We've got to get out!
-speak Matt 
You guys have to get out of that tunnel.
What do you do now, what's the process?
-speak Ashley 
We run!
-speak Sam 
Wait, we gotta get our stone friends out.
-speak Matt 
So, this is going into a skill challenge now.
-speak Laura 
Yeah, we all run out that–
-speak Sam 
No, we don't all run out, they're stone, we have to drag them out, yeah.
-speak Liam 
Who all's stone, it's Tiberius and Kima?
Okay.
-speak Marisha 
Can we– where's the magic carpet?
Throw their asses on the magic carpet!
-speak Laura 
Grog has the magic carpet.
Grog had everything.
-speak Sam 
Wait, Feather Fall, do you have Feather Fall?
-speak Ashley 
Before, before we leave, can I take some of the basilisk's blood and put it in a vial?
-speak Matt 
Okay, this will be the first skill challenge.
Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
-speak Ashley 
Dexterity check?
-speak Marisha 
Oh, can we get the magic carpet now?
-speak Matt 
No, the magic carpet is in the bag of holding.
That thing is huge.
You carry that with you, you would be at disadvantage for everything you've been doing.
-speak Orion 
Oh, I see.
-speak Ashley 
18!
-speak Matt 
18, okay, so.
I mean, you go over to it, and you manage to gather up into your wine skin a little bit of basilisk's blood, best you can.
The magma pulls close to you and you manage to just take six points of fire damage from just the general heat of the magma now pouring into the room.
It's spilling out and now just continuing to fill the rest of this chamber.
-speak Liam 
I shout to Percy, come, Tiberius, now!
-speak Taliesin 
We pick him up.
-speak Matt 
Both of you guys make an athletics check.
-speak Sam 
Oh, it's not a strength check?
-speak Matt 
For this, this is just an athletics to pull them all off.
-speak Liam 
19.
-speak Taliesin 
17.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
You guys grab and pull Tiberius out of the room.
It takes the two of you to heft him over.
You manage to pull him out of the way, that works out well.
Down the stairway, all right.
We don't need the video for this, we're just going to do this visually.
So, you guys manage to bring Tiberius down the stairway.
What are you doing, Scanlan?
-speak Sam 
I'm unfurling my Bull's Strength scroll and reading it so I get a plus five to strength?
Is that a thing?
-speak Matt 
All right, so that's Enhance Ability.
So you go ahead and give yourself Enhance Ability.
Your strength is now– you have advantage on all of your strength checks.
-speak Sam 
Okay, and I start to help, who was pushing Kima?
I'm gonna help push Kima out.
-speak Laura 
Oh wait, no!
Wait, didn't Clarota take Kima?
-speak Matt 
No, Clarota pulled Kima out of the room.
-speak Laura 
Oh, so we're all fucking fine, let's just get out.
-speak Matt 
So you guys are fine.
-speak Marisha 
I go ahead and on our way out I cast Create Water, and I kinda just use my air ability and make a mist to try and like mist the lava that's coming towards us.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
You do, but the magma's so intense and this has filled so much of the room now that you get a localized area.
The rest of it just kinda flows around and continues to fill the space.
All right, so.
All of you guys make a dexterity check to try to get down quickly.
Go for it.
-speak Ashley 
Can I make another one?
-speak Matt 
Yes, everyone makes one.
-speak Taliesin 
Natural 20.
-speak Liam 
Natural 20.
-speak Orion 
(hoarsely) I rolled a 19!
-speak Marisha 
20.
-speak Sam 
(sings) Seven!
-speak Ashley 
Four!
-speak Laura 
Do I get to roll twice 'cause of terrain?
-speak Matt 
Because of– yes you do.
-speak Sam 
Do I get my Enhance Ability?
-speak Matt 
Not for this one.
-speak Orion 
I would like to note that I am frozen like this.
-speak Matt 
Okay, Tiberius is.
-speak Laura 
29.
-speak Matt 
Okay, gotcha.
So, Pike and Scanlan, both of you guys are, unfortunately 'cause you're smaller and your legs are moving, you guys rush down the stairway and curl around.
As the rest of you make your way to the door, which is currently closed, you are all kinda gathered at the exterior of that hidden doorway.
It's currently dark and held shut on where you guys entered.
However, you two, the magma's now reached the stairway.
It's beginning to pour down off the top, and it manages to catch the two of you.
You guys each take five points of heat damage from the magma's proximity.
-speak Liam 
To the two ladies?
-speak Matt 
No, Pike and Scanlan.
You guys make it to the bottom floor.
The doorway is currently closed for the secret exit of the fortress.
-speak Liam 
Vax drops Tiberius' stone ass to the ground and starts feeling to get the mechanism of the door open.
-speak Sam 
Are we at the foot of the stairs yet, me and Pike?
-speak Matt 
You guys just make it to the foot of the stairs.
You guys are now–
-speak Marisha 
It's a big stone door?
-speak Matt 
Yeah, it's the one you guys, the one you guys– it opens up, outward.
-speak Marisha 
I just cast Stone Shape and make a hole.
-speak Matt 
Okay, as you're feeling around for the mechanism, Keyleth steps forward and basically the stone turns into almost a clay, and she just pulls it apart.
-speak Marisha 
Sorry, Vax.
I didn't mean to, like, overstep there.
-speak Matt 
A giant glob of magma pours down and splashes down onto the ground, hitting everyone in the vicinity.
Everyone down here takes 12 points of heat damage.
-speak Liam 
Ah, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot!
-speak Laura 
Hot hot hot hot hot.
-speak Liam 
All right, I'm picking up Tiberius' stone butt and continuing–
-speak Matt 
Okay, you guys push through the open hole that Keyleth pushed in, sweat dripping down your faces as the heat proximity to you is nigh-intolerable.
You make your way out of the gate and now you have that giant magma flow.
-speak Laura 
Oh, right!
Is the thing not– wasn't there–
-speak Matt 
No no– as you guys go and step out, the doorway that opened up, previously?
Is what parted the magma flow.
You pulled it open, so now it's just a wall of magma in front of you.
-speak Laura 
She also had created a wall barrier.
-speak Marisha 
I did create a wall over top.
-speak Matt 
You did.
It's not there anymore.
-speak Marisha 
It was permanent!
-speak Matt 
It was permanent, but a perpetual flow of magma on it for a period of a few hours will eventually eat through a stone wall.
-speak Laura 
Can you cast it again?
-speak Marisha 
I can.
Yeah.
Do it again.
Bam.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
It's probably the last of that.
You create a stone wall that juts out, once again blocking off the magma flow.
You guys all step out of the room just as the main force of magma begins to fill the room behind you.
Everyone make one more dexterity check to get out in time, as it's a small space and you're pushing out.
-speak Sam 
Natural 20.
-speak Orion 
16.
-speak Matt 
You made nothing.
-speak Marisha 
You made nothing.
-speak Taliesin 
Ten.
-speak Ashley 
Two.
-speak Laura 
Oh no.
29.
-speak Liam 
12.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
Everyone under 15: you, you, Percy, I believe, and Keyleth.
The magma now, as you're helping getting your friends out, you're pushing out, you push Vex out– Vex darts out, Scanlan manages to get out.
As you guys are pulling Tiberius through, the hefty force of magma comes funneling down into the room and splashes across the floor.
-speak Taliesin 
Oh, that's a lot of dice.
-speak Matt 
That is 18 points of heat damage.
-speak Liam 
Vax is unconscious.
-speak Marisha 
18 points?
-speak Matt 
As you're pushing through, Vax, you fall unconscious as the magma is currently lapping at the back of your leg.
The rest of you begin pushing out as you begin to realize that your half-elf friend is currently melting in a pool of magma.
-speak Ashley 
Can I grab him?
Can I grab him out?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a strength check.
This is strength at this point, this is pure adrenaline pushing through.
-speak Ashley 
12!
-speak Matt 
12.
You manage to start pulling him up through the hole that Keyleth made.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to assist, I'm pulling out– I'm doing another ice shot to try and cool off the magma around him.
-speak Laura 
I send Trinket up, to like, pull him.
-speak Matt 
Before you get to that point, as you're readying for it, 'cause it's a small space– as you're pulling it, giant bear claws come over and latch onto the back of Vax's armor.
The grizzly bear begins to tense, pulling back.
Makes a strength check.
That'll do it.
Both of you manage to pull you out.
You take an additional bit of heat damage.
You are now at two failed saving throws.
Two failed death saving throws.
-speak Liam 
I am a centimeter away from real death.
-speak Matt 
As he pulls it out, you can see most of his foot is melted.
And his right leg.
-speak Sam 
Aw, that's his best leg.
-speak Taliesin 
I pull a level two healing potion, just get it in his mouth.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you pull it out.
At this point, the magma's beginning to fill up the room, by the way.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, wait wait wait, can I take my stone wall and like, close it off?
We're all out, right?
-speak Matt 
You're outside of it.
How long does Stone Shape last?
-speak Marisha 
Stone Shape?
-speak Matt 
What you used on the wall.
-speak Marisha 
I'm just– I'm just taking it away.
-speak Matt 
Closing the wall?
-speak Marisha 
I'm closing it.
I can do it again, I still have two more spell slots.
-speak Matt 
Okay, how many spells do you have at that level?
-speak Marisha 
Three.
-speak Matt 
Three.
So you spent–
-speak Marisha 
One, so far.
-speak Matt 
One going out, coming– no, wait, it's the same– you haven't had a chance to do a full night's rest.
-speak Marisha 
I know.
I was an animal all week– all last game.
I didn't use any last game.
-speak Matt 
That's true, so you used the stone form, used Stone Wall.
-speak Marisha 
I used one Stone Wall last week and I have two level five spells now.
-speak Matt 
That's true, that's true, you do, that's good.
All right, I just wanted to make sure.
Okay, so as you do that, you send up another Stone Wall.
It blocks off the magma just as it begins to pour over and spill out into this vicinity.
It'll last a short time, but it'll last enough for what you guys need.
You guys drag–
-speak Ashley 
Can I heal him?
-speak Matt 
You can attempt to, yeah, go for it.
-speak Laura 
Anticipation.
-speak Marisha 
I know.
C'mon, Pike!
-speak Ashley 
24.
-speak Matt 
All right.
Heals you.
-speak Laura 
Oh my god.
-speak Matt 
Comes to consciousness.
You guys are about ten feet away from the base of the stronghold.
Your foot heals up, but it's still burned.
-speak Laura 
Ew, get that away from me.
-speak Matt 
For the time being, until you can take some serious physical rest, your movement is reduced by five.
And your stealth rolls are currently at disadvantage.
-speak Ashley 
Can that ever be healed?
-speak Matt 
Over time with some rest it can be, but right now– like, you're healed up, but that foot is scarred.
It probably spent a good six seconds completely submerged in molten lava.
-speak Liam 
Are you telling me I'll never compete in the roller derby again?
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
Quite possibly.
You all are just on the outskirts of the stronghold.
You can see now elements of the windows of the top floor are beginning to glow with internal light, as the entire stronghold is currently filling up entirely with molten rock.
-speak Sam 
Oh, I left my keys in there!
(laughter)

-speak Matt 
You're all resting for a moment, off to the side.
Grog is missing.
And you all take a moment to realize that somehow you all managed to survive this, mostly.
-speak Marisha 
Sort of.
-speak Matt 
However, you didn't find the vault, didn't find Kima's stuff, and a number of escaped individuals from this are out and at large.
We'll end today's game on that note.
-speak Liam 
Percy, I need Bad News to be my other foot now.
-speak Marisha 
Yeah, you should have– you need, like, a sweet pimp swagger now.
-speak Matt 
So that went a little long, guys.
Thank you for your– for hanging out, but that was an intense session.
Some climactic moments there.
-speak Liam 
Are you sure you guys don't want to send in a bulette, right now?
-speak Marisha 
Yeah, or maybe, like, you know, a black ooze.
You wanna do that?
-speak Sam 
Wow, guys.
-speak Zac 
That was fucking intense.
-speak Matt 
That was crazy!
-speak Zac 
Guys.
Riveting.
And exhausting.
Are you guys tired?
-speak All 
Yes.
-speak Zac 
No dancing tonight, guys, get over it.
-speak Ashley 
Sorry it went late.
-speak Laura 
That went so long, I'm sorry guys.
-speak Zac 
No, they are happy that you went late.
They want you to stay forever.
