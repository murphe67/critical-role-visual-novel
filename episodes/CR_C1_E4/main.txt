-speak Matt 
Everyone, welcome to this episode of Critical Role.
This evening, we luckily have Ashley Johnson back in as her character Pike.
-narrate 
Important note: Ashley is wearing a hairband with a pair of what looks like mouse ears.
-continue 
Unfortunately, Laura Bailey will be gone for most of the game, she might come in.
We'll see if she makes it, but in the mean time we'll miss her.
However we are happy to have Ashley with us.
-narrate 
Everyone cheers.
-continue 
She's come down from her BAFTA cloud. Which is amazing, congratulations again.
-speak Ashley 
Thank you guys.
-speak Matt 
We left off on Keyleth and Vex deciding they didn't want to listen to anyone's bullshit, and hijacking the magic carpet.
They flew down into the chasm below, and discovered a mind flayer.
-speak Marisha 
Clarence!
-speak Matt 
Clarota. I don't think he'll take kindly to Clarence.
He'd been cast out, he's covered in rags with a twisted physical form.
And after a very tense discussion, seemed to befriend it.
Or ay least agree to retribution against those oppressing his hive.
-speak Ashley 
I'm so nervous.
-speak Matt 
We open with Clarota speaking directly into your mind.
Through a horrifying whispered voice that you cannot even close your ears to get rid of:
-speak Clarota  
I think it's best we rest out of sight.
-speak Matt 
He points across the chasm, to the war camp that is looming across the way.
And he begins to float towards the abandoned goblinoid village.
-speak Liam 
I guess we should follow him, then.
-speak Matt 
You can see Clarota who is genuinely hovering about a foot off the ground, coasting around in a very creepy way.
Finds one tent, looks inside.
-speak Clarota  
Here we can talk.
-speak Matt 
He darts inside.
-speak Travis 
We follow.
-speak Matt 
As you're following–
-narrate 
Matt rolls a die.
-speak Travis 
Oh crap.
-speak Sam 
Oh God, we're dead.
-speak Travis 
Why? Why would he touch his dice?
We're gonna die!
-speak Matt 
As you're about to enter the tent, you see in the distance a small light. 
Back from the direction you came from.
-speak Grog 
That can't be good.
-speak Vax 
Stay with Clarota, I'm gonna go take a look.
-hide percy
-hide vex
-hide grog
-hide keyleth
-hide clarota
-speak Scanlan 
I'm coming with.
-speak Travis 
I'm going to stay outside the tent if anybody wants to ask how to get a Magneto helmet.
Because I'm gonna need that.
-speak Matt 
Vax and Scanlan, roll stealth.
-speak Sam 
Not great. 9.
-speak Liam 
29.
-speak Matt 
Vax officially vanishes into the ether and surrounding darkness.
Scanlan, with his earlier song still stuck in his head, starts humming to himself without realizing.
Calling a little bit of attention.
At which point you hear some footsteps in the distance come to an immediate halt.
-speak Liam 
I grab Scanlan, put my hand over his mouth.
-speak Vax 
Quiet, man, what's wrong with you?
-speak Scanlan 
It's a nervous habit! I'm sorry!
-speak Vax 
With great power comes great responsibility, shut up!
-speak Scanlan 
It's a gift I have to share with the world!
-speak Vax 
Later, later. Save it for the mind flayer.
-speak Liam 
So with him tucked under my arm like a football, I creep further.
And try with darkvision to make out some details.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a perception check.
-speak Sam 
I also have darkvision.
-speak Matt 
You can make a perception check with disadvantage, because you're under his arm.
-speak Sam 
Nope.
-speak Liam 
11.
-speak Matt 
There's a pillar that's blocking your view, but you can see the shadows moving.  
You can kind of hear some shuffling, it sounds kind of like plate armor.
And a voice just kind of muttering to itself.
A familiar, female gnomish voice.
-speak Vax 
Pike?
-show pike 4
-speak Pike 
Hey guys!
It's me, Pike!
-speak Vax 
Jeez, where have you been?
-speak Pike 
Oh man, I've had quite a time.
I've missed you guys terribly.
A lot has happened. I'm sure for you guys as well.
-speak Scanlan 
Not so much.
-speak Matt 
As you guys take a look at Pike, you notice she's fully armored.
Dirty, she's got sweat across her face.
Looks like she may have had a couple scuffles on the way through here.
-speak Ashley 
I did.
-speak Matt 
She's got a wild look to her eyes.
Genuinely relieved to see you.
Pike, you've managed to come down through the front of the mines, which for the most part have been clear.
After realizing your party had ventured below without you, you followed the tracks best you could.
But you know you're lucky you ran into them before something far more dangerous.
You're currently standing in an abandoned campsite in a large cavern.
What also catches your eye, is a giant symbol carved into a nearby stone wall.
It is a protective sigil of the god Bahamut, the platinum dragon.
-speak Vax 
We were looking at that, we couldn't make heads or tails of it.
You ever seen that before?
-speak Pike 
No!
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a religion check.
-speak Vax 
Are you sure?
Think about it, just for a moment longer.
-speak Pike 
Well give me, actually, let me rethink on this.
I think maybe–
-speak Ashley 
Oh, it's a natural 20!
-speak Marisha 
Welcome back!
-speak Travis 
The first roll.
-speak Pike 
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it-
-speak Matt 
You clutch your holy symbol instinctually, as you reach up and run your fingers along the carving.
You close your eyes, and you feel Sarenrae's warmth fill your mind.
And for a split moment, you can see a well-armored female halfling in your mind's eye.
Her hair is pulled back into tight brown braids, a dark green cloak thrown over one shoulder.
She slowly carves this sigil into the stone.
You're seeing Lady Kima of Vord, who left this symbol to protect her campsite.
You don't get any sense of how long ago this was, though.
-speak Vax 
What is it?
-speak Pike 
It was left by a woman.
-speak Scanlan 
Lady Kima, the one we're trying to find?
-speak Pike 
Yes, Lady Kima.
-speak Scanlan 
It's so great to see you, you look fantastic by the way.
-speak Pike 
I don't feel fantastic.
-speak Scanlan 
Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug.
Ooh, you smell a little.
I like it though. Somehow it works on you.
-speak Vax 
We're in a very complicated situation, a lot has happened to us.
We found sort of a war camp down here.
And there is some sort of a creature, I don't know what to call it.
He's got some tentacles going on, some telepathy.
We fought a huge force down here, and then we ended up falling into a cavern.
And then Keyleth and my sister found another one, what are they called?
Illithids.
-speak Scanlan 
Yes, yes. We found a rogue one.
And we may team up with him to go back and get revenge, and maybe kick some ass in the camp.
-speak Vax 
This just happened.
He seems extremely dangerous.
However, the other illithid seems maybe worse.
So that's where we're at.
-speak Scanlan 
So welcome back.
Let's rejoin our friends, shall we?
-speak Pike 
Let's go kick some ass.
-speak Sam 
So we trot back over to the dead goblin village.

-speak Matt 
All right, you make your way back to the tent.
Clarota is awkwardly sitting in the far end, watching you approach.
-speak Pike 
Hello everybody.
-speak Everyone 
Pike!
-narrate 
The cast all mime hugging Pike.
-speak Keyleth 
Where have you been?
-speak Pike 
Well, I had quite a time.
In Kraghammer I noticed something, and I felt… 
I had to leave, because I started to have a vision.
I feel like I should talk to you guys about this later, just because–
-speak Scanlan 
It's personal?
-narrate 
Ashley turns to Matt.
-speak Pike 
What is your name? I'm so sorry.
I'm Pike, it's very nice to meet you.
-speak Matt 
You get a better look as you approach this entity.
He's very tall, gaunt.
Smooth, bluish-purple skin.
These sunken, creepy, yellowish green eyes.
And instead of where a mouth or nose would be, you see four slightly twitching tentacles.
Barely obscuring what looks like a round lamprey-like toothed maw.
-speak Vax 
Pike, this is Clarota.
We've just met.
-speak Ashley 
Can I shake his hand?
-speak Matt 
Do you wanna reach your hand out?
-speak Ashley 
Yes.
-speak Matt 
There is no physical response, the hand is not extended.
But you hear in your mind, a creepy whispered voice go:
-scene set2
-speak Clarota  
Are you to be one of our allies as well?
-speak Pike 
Yes. Of course.
-speak Clarota  
Very well, she may stay.
-speak Ashley 
I take my hand and scratch the back of my head.
-speak Marisha 
I grab Pike and pull her out of the tent really quick.
-speak Scanlan 
Girl talk.
-speak Keyleth 
Okay he's like a mind flayer, and we found him in a hole under a waterfall.
But he's cool, he wants vengeance.
-speak Pike 
The tinfoil hat, that keeps him-
-speak Keyleth 
He's like outcast, yeah.
But he's gonna help us fight all of his tribe who hates us.
-speak Pike 
Do we know for sure he's helping us?
-speak Keyleth 
Yeah.
-speak Vax 
Clarota, can you help us understand your kind? Your history?
How you've come to be here, and who is this individual fucking with your shit?
-speak Matt 
Proverbial statement, I like that.
Clarota's eyes narrow, and the general mood grows tense.
-speak Clarota  
It's been 7 years since I discovered my curse.
My form was struck with the brand of the arcane.
And these foul arts proved difficult to conceal.
My brethren could sense my impurity, my deviation, and cast me out.
I was severed from the Elder Brain.
Chased away on threat of death should I return.
I wandered these tunnels in squalor, feeding on what paltry filth I could ensnare.
Fleeing from the ones I could not face alone.
In my wandering, I discovered a duergar stronghold, and it proved to be a decent source of sustenance for some time.
Picking off the occasional straggler.
Suddenly a great battle took place.
It appeared something had sieged the stronghold.
Reading the thoughts of the deep dwarves, I found a shift of power.
Whatever had taken this hold had now demanded fealty of them.
And when faced with annihilation, they accepted.
This entity that took the duergar by force was called K'varn.
I caught no sight of it.
But the fear I sensed was so primal, so great, that I knew to keep away.
Four months ago one of my people was captured by these ash-skins and brought within the obsidian walls.
Not long after, the duergar people marched through the long, deep tunnels that led to my people's colony, and attacked.
Strangely, before much bloodshed could occur, the fighting stopped.
And the colony allowed the ash skins to walk directly into the temple.
Unharmed, unchallenged, to where our Elder Brain resides.
I later discovered that whoever this K'varn is, they had infiltrated the temple during the battle.
And somehow took control of the Elder Brain.
I watched as the free will of my people was taken from them.
And then they took the will of all that lives and breathes in these tunnels.
Now, a terrible army is forged of both factions, walking under the banner of this K'varn.
I fled back to the higher tunnels, and scrounged for materials so I could shield myself from the iron grip of the now enslaved Elder Brain.
It took me weeks. But I'm confident I'm safe from its influence.
For now.
-speak Percy 
Is that the thing that you wear upon your head?
-speak Matt 
It pulls the hood back, you see again this headpiece made of patches of metal haphazardly fused together.
It has this dull blue glow, dim enough that you can only see it in pitch darkness.
-speak Clarota  
Yes. It can protect me.
And I believe we can turn the tide of this situation.
If I could somehow free my people from K'varn, release its hold on the hive mind, my people would allow me to rejoin the colony.
To be one again with my family. My brethren.
-speak Vax 
I have a few questions. Is that all right?
-speak Clarota  
Yes.
-speak Vax 
You and your brethren, without this K'varn, do you think as one?
-speak Clarota  
We think as individuals, but the hive mind connects us all.
The hive mind gives us knowledge, history, direction.
It is the source of our family.
-speak Vax 
So, one individual of your family sees something, the entire hive sees the same, is that correct?
-speak Clarota  
Yes.
-speak Keyleth 
Well, fuck.
-speak Vax 
And you mentioned the arcane being a stigma upon you?
-speak Matt 
It turns its gaze away, and slinks down slightly.
-speak Vax 
What do your brethren put their faith in, if not the arcane?
-speak Clarota  
They put their faith in the arts of the mind.
Understanding, manipulating, controlling, and devouring.
-speak Scanlan 
Your headpiece, it protects you from these arts of the mind, from the Elder Brain.
If someone of our troup were to be influenced, it could be very bad.
What I mean to say is-
-speak Grog 
I would like a steel beanie as well.
-speak Pike 
Basically, where do we get one of those?
-speak Clarota  
It would take weeks to build another.
-speak Grog 
Weeks?
-speak Percy 
I would like to take a look into it if possible, and see if it makes sense. I am a builder.
If we were all hidden, we would have a distinct advantage.
-speak Grog 
I have a very large bronze pot in the bag of holding.
Could I wear that on me noggin?
-speak Percy 
If you like.
-speak Matt 
It gives you a look in response and says:
-speak Clarota  
This protects me from the influence of the hive mind, my innate connection.
-speak Percy 
Could we be hidden from them?
Would there be a way to cloak ourselves from their understanding?
-speak Clarota  
Stay hidden. Their sight is the mind's sight.
The Elder Brain is a collection of the once living mind flayers of my people.
-speak Vax 
I have one more question, and we have allied ourselves to you, that's true.
But I'm curious to know, once we achieve our goal, what happens then for the Illithid?
Do you return to your home below?
Do your people harbor any ambition to move upward into Kraghammer?
-speak Clarota  
Our ambition is to pursue the continuation of our knowledge-seeking.
We have no interest in the surface.
We only wish to spread our dominion here below.
Expand our great city of Yug'Voril.
-speak Percy 
I feel that we could come to an arrangement.
We would require of you, at the very least, safe passage back to the surface.
For ourselves, and for a friend of ours who's lost in the darkness, who we are here to retrieve.
-speak Clarota  
For this deed, for freeing my people from this insidious presence that is K'varn…
I believe this could be arranged.
-speak Liam 
Scanlan, does he speak true?
-speak Sam 
Uh. Let's find out.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make an insight check.
-speak Sam 
What am I adding to this?
-speak Liam 
Insight.
-speak Sam 
13. I'm not an insight person.
-speak Ashley 
Can I make one as well? 
Natural 20.
-speak Matt 
He seems to be speaking from a point of desperation, as he has no other option.
You can see in the way he talks, he's a little crazy.
The isolation has pushed him so that he'll do whatever it takes to get back with his family.
He also seems to be, in a weird way, appreciative that you're willing to help.
Seemingly genuine.
-speak Travis 
Is the helmet still an option?
-speak Sam 
No, the helmet is what separates him from his hive mind.
It wouldn't help us at all.
-speak Travis 
I'll still wear the big bronze pot on my head.
-speak Matt 
You put the pot on your head.
It's clunky. You cannot see.
-speak Travis 
No, but I'm protected from the flayer.
-speak Sam 
Can you bore some holes in?
-speak Travis 
I don't need it, I have incredible warrior skills.
-speak Vax 
So there any way to be hidden?
-speak Clarota  
To be hidden from sight. Hidden from knowledge.
-speak Keyleth 
Clarence? Sorry, Clarota.
-speak Scanlan 
How about Clay?
-speak Clarota  
Clarota!
-speak Keyleth 
Sorry, Clarota.
I just have one quick question. Why would you want to rejoin your colony after they've banished you?
Why not leave?
-speak Clarota  
I have nowhere to go.
They are my essence, my connection.
I long to return.
I understand their choice, I understand that I am cursed.
I look upon this disease, and spit.
But perhaps, with this deed, they can overlook it.
-speak Keyleth 
You're not diseased, you're special.
-speak Grog 
Oh, God.
-speak Clarota  
You know nothing of my culture.
You presume too much.
-speak Scanlan 
Question, Clarota.
The war camp.
Is that something that we need to face headlong, or can we maybe bypass them and go deeper?
-speak Clarota  
Whichever you desire. Their stronghold is far below.
The magma leads the way.
However, the general resides in that camp.
I know of no way to enter their stronghold, other than by frontal assault.
Perhaps the general can be pried for information. If you bring him to me.
-speak Scanlan 
Understood.
-speak Grog 
Can we pick up the little loch ness monster and throw it at him or something?
-speak Matt 
Clarota actually hisses.
-speak Clarota  
No, avoid.
That creature is older than all of us.
An ancient mind. One that should be kept at bay.
An aboleth.
-speak Scanlan 
All right, so let's review our options, shall we?
-speak Grog 
We gotta charge in there.
-speak Scanlan 
We can't charge, there's a chasm.
-speak Vax 
And charging went so well with that little brain thing.
-speak Percy 
The chasm is a problem.
-speak Scanlan 
We can fly in death from above.
-speak Grog 
I don't know if I can.
-speak Scanlan 
Well, we can figure out a way.
Enough of us can turn into flying things to get you there.
-speak Pike 
In my vision I saw-
I don't know if I should be talking about this in front of him.
-speak Grog 
We could go away from him for a second.
-speak Vax 
He will probably hear the thoughts inside your mind.
-speak Pike 
Earmuffs?
Well, shall I share a vision I had?
-speak Vax 
I think so, Pike.
-speak Pike 
In this vision that I had, I was pulled down toward the mines.
Into the tunnels, below where the dwarves were working.
Past the goblinoid creatures, past a great underground lake.
Past a jagged onyx colored fortress, framed in molten rock.
-speak Grog 
We haven't been there yet.
-speak Pike 
Past a field of broken glass and bone.
Have you seen any of this?
-speak Keyleth 
No.
-speak Scanlan 
Those last things sound terrible.
-speak Vax 
Yes, that all sounds shitty.
The last thing we've seen is the lake, and we didn't get too close to it, because something in the lake was eating trolls.
But if it was in your vision?
Maybe if we investigate the lake we'll find a way past the camp.
-speak Keyleth 
How is the lake gonna get us to the general?
We need the information from the general to get into the fortress.
-speak Scanlan 
What's the best-case scenario?
What, we come up behind them? It's still gonna be a fight.
We can fly over them, that seems like a pretty good attack point.
There's an ancient death thing in the lake.
-speak Vax 
I mean, we can vote on it.
Although we all know Keyleth is just gonna go fucking do whatever she wants.
-speak Keyleth 
That was one time.
-speak Vax 
Just the one time.
-speak Grog 
Never to be forgotten.
-speak Vax 
Our options are a headlong advance into the middle of their camp.
That's a big fucking force.
-speak Scanlan 
Or some sort of disguise, distraction.
When I was there, I saw the mind flayer control all of them instantly.
If we could somehow get to him, and cut off that connection, distract him, influence him to get all of them to jump in the lake.
That would get rid of a lot of them all at once.
-speak Vax 
Can you make me invisible?
-speak Scanlan 
I can make you a fly?
-speak Percy 
Clarota, may I examine your device?
-speak Matt 
He glares at you and says:
-speak Clarota  
Our agreement does not include this interaction.
-speak Percy 
I won't touch. Just a look.
-speak Matt 
It kind of bows its head, just slightly showing you an element of it.
-speak Taliesin 
Do I understand how it functions?
-speak Matt 
It appears to be a very simple piece of metal, hammered together.
-speak Taliesin 
So it's magic.
-speak Matt 
It looks like it is some sort of enchantment.
-speak Taliesin 
So there'd be no way to build something to create a feedback loop?
-speak Matt 
You have never interacted with anything psionic-based before.
The time to research that, and the materials needed to do it would take months.
-speak Percy 
Moving on then:
If they rely on sight, what if we blind them?
With a really bright light.
-speak Keyleth 
I believe Pike and I both have access to spells like that.
-speak Scanlan 
I assume that would make us pretty blind as well.
-speak Grog 
Vax could show his ass, that's a pretty white light.
-speak Percy 
That's as white as it gets.
-speak Vax 
It's pale as shit.
When I go to the beach, I don't tan, I stroke.
-speak Sam 
They don't need to see us, they just need to know we're there.
-speak Taliesin 
But they need to make that visual contact in the first place.
-speak Clarota  
The dark, deep dwarves, they hate light. This I know.
-speak Keyleth 
Pike, can we temporarily enchant the magic carpet as a spotlight as we fly over?
As a light death ray?
-speak Vax 
We've seen you surrounded in radiant light before, you think you can do that to the carpet?
-speak Pike 
We could cast Daylight?
-speak Vax 
It shouldn't be hard to get hold of some pitch down here, some tar.
-speak Scanlan 
To burn?
-speak Vax 
No.
If you can be invisible, and you have a ring of mind shielding?
Could you can carry a bucket of pitch to that motherfucker, splash it on its face, cover its eyes, and it's helpless.
-speak Percy 
My God.
-speak Scanlan 
Or I can hang that big brass pot on its head.
-speak Grog 
But I'm wearing that!
-speak Vax 
It could take a pot off.
If you smear sticky shit on its eyes–
-speak Scanlan 
I have a Blindness spell?
-speak Clarota  
If it were blind, it would be very difficult for it to pry into your mind.
-speak Scanlan 
Could it still control the others, though?
-speak Clarota  
Probably. That is a permanent enslavement.
-speak Scanlan 
So you want me to go in there, solo, invisible, and try to blind this thing.
I'm in!
-speak Vax 
Well, not solo.
I like your idea of turning me into a fly.
Scanlan and I could get in close, blind it, and I could stab it in the head.
-speak Keyleth 
I can also turn into something flying, I could back you guys up.
If someone else wants to take the carpet.
-speak Scanlan 
We can all get there.
-speak Keyleth 
I could also cast Daylight on Grog's pot.
-speak Grog 
Now that I'm game with.
I'll be like a lighthouse, walking around.
-speak Matt 
You'd be the cover of John Carpenter's "The Thing".
-speak Percy 
What if we went in on two fronts?
-speak Vax 
Yes, two fronts.
Scanlan and I separate from the group. They go in shining like a beacon. 
while the illithid is focused on them, we go in, you blind him, and I stab him in his maw.
It's pretty good.
-speak Scanlan 
That's a suicide mission.
-speak Grog 
I like it, let's do it.
-speak Percy 
I'm behind this plan.
-speak Scanlan 
Surgical, special ops, seal team six.
-speak Keyleth 
I need a long rest to prep the right spells.
-speak Clarota  
If you need rest, then rest.
Time of day has no bearing down here.
-speak Grog 
I'm gonna read up on this Chopping Head spell.
Yep, I'm read up.
-speak Marisha 
I go ahead and I light an incense in our teepee, and I make some flowers grow.
-speak Keyleth 
That's better. That's nice.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm gonna do a little bit of work on that first trick arrow.
On the trap arrow. Since I've got a little time.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a roll.
-speak Taliesin 
17.
-speak Matt 
And what are you trying to accomplish with this arrow again?
-speak Taliesin 
I was trying to make an entanglement arrow.
-speak Matt 
You manage to work out what seems like a tanglefoot bag-type detonation.
It would cause a grapple check against the individual, probably give them penalties until they're able to break free of the grapple.
So yeah, success on that one.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm gonna be Hawkeyeing Laura out at some point, I got a couple of them.
-speak Matt 
Clarota closes his eyes, and kind of goes into a meditative stance.
The rest of you, those who have spells to choose, go ahead and choose your spells accordingly for the next day.
-speak Sam 
I'm just doing my vocal warmups.
-speak Scanlan 
~Me me me me me me me me me~
-speak Marisha 
I'm meditating.
-speak Sam 
~Molto bene, molto bene, molto bene, molto bene~
-speak Travis 
"The human torch was denied a bank loan."
-speak Matt 
So as you all have your evening's rest.
It's not very comfortable.
One, you're in the middle of a tent of a goblinoid city.
Second, just the general proximity of sleeping near an illithid.
You just have a general sense of unsettling dreams, imagery that is disturbing.
Pike, you have many flashbacks to the vision you had, and actually wake partway through the night in a cold sweat.
As you wake up, you all kind of slowly come to, it's about four hours into the evening's rest.
You feel a slight tremor, a familiar tremor that you felt once before in this cavern.
You feel the ground begin to vibrate and shake.
-speak Taliesin 
I get up and look around.
-speak Sam 
Is Clay awake?
-speak Matt 
Eyes are open, just sitting there.
-speak Scanlan 
Clarota, do you know what that rumbling is?
-speak Clarota  
There are many creatures that live in this rock.
You'd best be still.
-speak Scanlan 
Ooh, still.
-speak Matt 
Everyone make a stealth check.
-speak Marisha 
Oh!
-speak Travis 
Fucking nipples.
-speak Marisha 
Pooper.

-speak Matt 
Two natural ones?
-speak Travis 
Yup!
-speak Sam 
After her two natural 20's.
-speak Ashley 
Well I'm new to armor, you know.
-speak Matt 
You both rolled natural ones.
Those both count as two failures.
-speak Ashley 
Fuck.
-speak Matt 
Thankfully, the rest of your group all rolled pretty high.
So it was four versus five.
-speak Matt 
You guys just barely succeed.
As you all hold still, barely breathe, the rumbling intensifies, and goes on for a good minute, minute and a half, before it eventually subsides.
-speak Travis 
Aw. Thought we were gonna get a warm up.
-speak Matt 
Fades into the distance.
Rumbling is complete. It appears to be no issue.
-speak Clarota  
Many of these creatures, they pick up on movement. Be wary.
-speak Vax 
What creatures are you speaking of now?
-speak Clarota  
I've only got glimpses.
-speak Vax 
This is something worse than umberhulks, I assume.
-speak Clarota  
Larger, yes.
-speak Vax 
Buttholes in the underdark!
-speak Scanlan 
All right, we've all rested up.
So the plan is you and I stealth.
The rest, attack with light?
What's first, what's second, what happens here?
-speak Liam 
I'm gonna look around and see if I can find any pitch, anywhere in the goblin camp.
-speak Matt 
Okay, go ahead and make a investigation check.
-speak Liam 
12.
-speak Matt 
Takes about an hour.
You manage to find, essentially, a few piles of rather disgusting, sticky, goblinoid refuse, that you imagine will probably stick and burn pretty well.
In a pitch-type way, yeah.
-speak Liam 
Goblin shit?
-speak Matt 
You find just a whole bunch of goblin shit.
-speak Liam 
Let's cook it up a little.
-speak Taliesin 
How do you feel about lacing it with gun powder?
-speak Liam 
Feel pretty good about that.
-speak Marisha 
Goblin molotov cocktails?
I like that.
-speak Taliesin 
Goblin poop cocktail.
-speak Vax 
So here's how I think this goes.
I think the team infuses the carpet, and any shields, or head pots they have with radiant light.
They go in and make a big stink on the side of the camp.
You and I go in, you're invisible.
I'm a–
-speak Scanlan 
Fly, flea, mosquito, dragonfly, whatever you'd like.
-speak Vax 
We go in, find the illithid, and then we pop in, you yell, "Hey, Spanky", throw goblin shit in its face.
-speak Scanlan 
Or I try to blind it with magic.
-speak Percy 
Both.
-speak Vax 
We want to increase our odds.
As soon as he's blind, I go in for the kill.
And then it's on us to deal with what happens after that.
-speak Grog 
It's playtime.
-speak Scanlan 
Might I suggest one other wrinkle.
Remember there are some dwarves being held captive.
We can make our way to them and release them.
-speak Grog 
We don't need all of them, though.
Just to cause further distraction, or to get some allies on the inside.
-speak Vax 
It's possible they could be weary, frightened.
-speak Percy 
Mind controlled.
-speak Vax 
Seems unreliable.
-speak Scanlan 
All right.
How are we going to get Grog over there?
-speak Keyleth 
I'm gonna put a giant sunlight beacon on his head, and I'm gonna release him to the wilds.
-speak Vax 
Yes, but there's no bridge, we talked about–
-speak Keyleth 
Oh, how are we gonna get him over it?
I'll carry him as an eagle.
-speak Grog 
Sick.
-speak Vax 
Clarota, is there anything you can do to help us on this endeavor?
-speak Clarota  
I can try to cloud his mind with mine, but you have to swear to protect me from harm.
-speak Vax 
You have our word.
-speak Scanlan 
Our word that we will try.
-speak Clarota  
Then I will come.
You must work swiftly.
If we can bypass most of the city, storm that barrack, and take out the mind flayer that resides.
-speak Scanlan 
Let's set down right in the middle of the thing.
-speak Vax 
That's a good idea.
If we go as high as we can, and just hug the ceiling of this motherfucker, and then go down in the middle.
And as we're going down, you turn me into a fly and go invisible, and that's when all hell breaks lose.
-speak Grog 
Let's do it.
-speak Vax 
No time like the present.
-speak Grog 
Hands up if you're in.
-speak Marisha 
I'm gonna start buffing people like crazy.
-speak Taliesin 
Gonna be buffing us like a vampire slayer.
-speak Marisha 
Oh! Joss Whedon up in this bitch!
-speak Sam 
Question to the dungeon master.
I think my Polymorph spell is a concentration spell.
-speak Matt 
It is, yes.
-speak Sam 
I can make you a fly, but I can't be invisible at the same time.
-speak Liam 
I will sneak through.
If shit goes south, I will peel off and join the others.
We're just gonna have to improvise that.
We'll do it live, we'll do it live.
-speak Marisha 
I'm going to cast Pass Without A Trace.
That gives us all +10 to our stealth checks.
-speak Ashley 
Oh, nice!
-speak Travis 
I would like to cast, um, Blood Lust on myself.
-speak Sam 
I'm gonna sing a little ditty to inspire Vax.
-narrate
To the tune of "The Sign", by Ace of Base:
-speak Scanlan 
~I didn't see the Vax~
~'Cause he's so goddamned stealthy~
~Da da da da da da da da~
-speak Travis 
Was that "I Saw The Sign"?
-speak Sam 
Yes it was.
-speak Matt 
That wondrous rendition allows you a d8 inspiration dice, hold on to that.
-speak Vax 
Vox Machina, let's do this shit.
-speak Marisha 
I turn into an eagle, and I pick up Grog.

-speak Travis 
Amazing, don't puke in the helmet though, that would be gross.
I can't see anything. Just a cauldron on my head.
-speak Marisha 
I guess the rest of them are on the rug?
-speak Sam 
Are we all in flight now?
-speak Liam 
We're all taken care of, yes.
-speak Vax 
Scanlan, we are probably going to die today.
It has been an honor.
-speak Scanlan 
It has been an honor.
-speak Pike 
You won't die today.
-speak Scanlan 
Only one of us will die.
And it won't be me.
I can be invisible.
-speak Matt 
You guys are all coasting over the chasm.
Now you're over the top of the large bridge, and the 200-foot-wide open hole in this tunnel that leads to the lake below.
As you glance down, you can see just a little bit of a trickle from the soft red light that is deeper inside.
You can see the small streams of lava, they're just slowly pooling at the bottom on the outskirts of the lake proper.
-background kraghammer
-continue 
As you begin to make it to the other side, you can see tiny shapes moving in this barely lit war camp of the duergar.
As you're coasting over, and Clarota is along with you guys with his hood up, he kind of whispers into all of your heads, just, 
-speak Clarota  
Beware that some of these armies carry abominations created below within my city.
I know not what to expect from them. So be wary.
-speak Matt 
As this happens, everyone make a stealth check.
Everyone, because of the Pass Without A Trace, everyone gets a +10 to their stealth check.
-speak Marisha

-speak Sam

-speak Taliesin 
22.
-speak Travis 
27.
-speak Sam 
Wow.
-speak Ashley 
23.
-speak Liam 
28.
-speak Matt 
You guys begin to crest over the war camp, and you notice these tunneling siege engines being constructed.
You can see giant wheeled carts with drills up front, giant auger bores that are being constructed.
You can see a series of weapons, stacked at the ready.
You can see there is a preparation for an attack on the city above.
-speak Liam 
They want to take Kraghammer.
-speak Matt 
You continue to press ahead.
There does not seem to be any reaction to your flying.
-speak Liam 
We stay close to the ceiling.
-speak Matt 
You make it to the center portion of the city.
You can see this opening in the center of the camp.
There is a circle where there are no tents constructed, you can see what looks to be a small wooden platform, and there is a makeshift stone building.
Not pretty, but functional.
It looks like a barracks, or some sort of a large bunker.
-speak Scanlan 
They're in there.
-speak Sam 
Does it have a roof?
-speak Matt 
There is a roof to it, but you don't know if there's any roof access.
-speak Scanlan 
Should we land on the roof?
Or do we land right outside the barracks door?
What do we do?
-speak Pike 
Roof, roof, roof.
-speak Scanlan 
You guys wanna stay up and we'll go down?
-speak Grog 
Yes.
-speak Keyleth 
We can start on the roof, that way that gives us time.
-speak Scanlan 
I'm so scared right now.
-speak Matt 
You guys descend.
-speak Orion 
Down, down.
-speak Matt 
Eagle flies down,
As part of the landing, everyone make a secondary stealth check.
-speak Marisha 
We still have that +10?
-speak Matt 
You still have the spell.
-speak Taliesin 
Yeah!
-speak Marisha 
Oh, no!
-speak Sam 
30.
-speak Marisha 
I'm like those boobies, that crash land when they fall.
-speak Matt 
You rolled at disadvantage?
-speak Marisha 
Well, I rolled a 1.
-speak Matt 
Two failures.
-speak Taliesin 
29.
-speak Travis 
23.
-speak Ashley 
21.
-speak Liam 
28.
-speak Matt 
Pass Without A Trace is the saving grace.
A bit of a harsh landing, from your perspective.
It looks like the roof is made of scavenged wood.
-speak Pike 
Let's go in through the roof.
-speak Percy 
It's reclaimed, it's very nice.
-speak Vax 
If that thing sees us, though, it could be game over.
I still think we should stick to the plan of blinding it.
-speak Scanlan 
So some of us need to go inside.
-speak Vax 
You and I.
-speak Grog 
Yeah, the two go inside, and if shit goes down, we light it up.
-speak Vax 
I will fucking yell into my earring if shit goes down, and you guys gotta pray for me.
-speak Grog 
Go find shit!
-speak Scanlan 
We look around for any roof access.
-speak Grog 
Come on, Chip 'n' Dale.
-hide gianteagle
-show keyleth -4
-speak Marisha 
I'm going to drop eagle form and cast Enhance Ability on Vax.
That's going to drop Pass Without A Trace, but he'll have advantage on stealth checks.
-speak Liam 
Oh, thank you.
-speak Matt 
Looking around, there is no roof entrance.
It looks like it is purely a functional roof.
There are a few small rocks and pieces of cavern that may have fallen down.
-speak Sam 
Any chimneys?
-speak Matt 
No chimneys.
But there are a couple of small window openings.
-speak Sam 
Ok, we'll go in through one of them.
I've discovered I can upcast Invisibility to 3rd level and cast it on two people, so I will make both of us invisible.
-hide vax

-speak Vax 
Holy shit, where are my hands?
-speak Matt 
You immediately disappear from view.
You currently, visually do not exist.
-speak Sam 
We can see the window, we pick one of the sides, I don't know, west side.
-speak Matt 
West side!
-speak Sam 
Is it a single pane?
Is it an openable window?
-speak Matt 
As you glance over, it is just an opening.
There is no glass. There is nothing blocking the way.
It is about roughly big enough to fit a normal-sized half-elf or human.

Go ahead and just make an acrobatics check.
-speak Sam 
Don't roll a 1, please don't drop me.
-speak Liam

-speak Matt 
Yeah, you're good.
You gingerly scale down the wall, the stones thankfully are just haphazardly put together, where there's enough grip space for you to catch on.
-speak Sam 
I have a climbing kit!

We can't talk to each other.
We can't signal each other, and we don't know where each other is.
I hold his hand.
-speak Liam 
We're holding hands, I'm leaning way down on the side.
-speak Travis 
'Course you are.
-speak Liam 
Sam and I have done this before.
-speak Matt 
You look about you, and there are some ramshackle, makeshift beds in the room.
Five to be exact, from right to left.
This appears to be one portion of a barracks-type sleeping arrangement.
Beds are empty, they're kind of tossed, they're not like well-kept or anything.
There's sheets kind of tossed about, and it smells awful in here.
-speak Liam 
I tug on his hand to keep going into the barracks.
-speak Sam 
I notice that his hand is weirdly cold and sweaty.
-speak Liam 
You just learn to live with the stage fright, you never move past it.

Laura joins the table.
-speak Laura 
Hello!
-speak Liam 
We'll bring you up to speed later, you're on the roof of Osama Bin Laden's house.
So question for the DM, I'm invisible.
Do I need to stealth?
-speak Matt 
There's still a stealth check because noise is still a factor.
You have advantage on it.
-speak Liam 
So, I think we should probably stealth.
And start moving in.
-speak Sam 
Yeah, that's, we tug each other.
-speak Matt 
Beyond being invisible, you guys make your stealth check.
-speak Sam

There is one duergar in that hallway.
There doesn't appear to be a doorway or entrance to the central chamber on this side of the hallway.
-speak Sam 
That's pretty good.
-speak Liam 
I still have the pitch in a bucket.
-speak Sam 
We can take these guys, I'm not worried about that.
-speak Liam 
But we'd make noise.
How far apart are the two duergar standing in that door?
-speak Matt 
They're about five feet apart.
-speak Liam 
I pull a gold coin out of my pocket, and throw it to the far corner.
-speak Sam 
This is straight up Metal Gear.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and just make a general dexterity check.
-speak Liam 
And because of Keyleth, I have advantage, correct?
So that's a 17.

There's a ringing sound as it lands, both of the duergar kinda look over.
They look at each other. Grunt for a second.

You yank the head back, and take the base of the blade, go ahead and make an attack roll.
It's a surprise roll, so you have an advantage on the attack.

That is going to hit, and that is a critical hit.

But you catch it and keep holding it there, so it doesn't make any noise.
You're now clutching a dead duergar.

What you do notice, though, is there a giant kind of war room table, at the top of this raised platform.
It's about 2 feet up, and there's a stairway that leads up to it.
You see at the table, one of the illithid mind flayers.
The armored general that you saw before.

The poison does not seem to take effect, the body resists it.
It is still alive.
It's clutching the back of its neck, it turns around.
You can see blood spurting out of its mouth, and its eyes are now just burning with rage.

I got a 9 for initiative.
Not to brag.

All right, top of the round is Vax, with initiative.
-speak Liam 
I'm just gonna stab in the back of his head some more.
-speak Matt 
You are now visible, you are not stealthed.
-speak Liam 
Stab him in the back of the head.
For assassinate, do I get the critical still here, DM?
-speak Matt 
No.
It is so aware of you, it has never been more aware of you in its life.
-speak Liam 
I just rolled a 28 on the flame tongue dagger.
-speak Matt 
Okay, that definitely hits.
-speak Liam 
8 damage.
24 to hit on the second attack, for another 8 damage.
-speak Matt 
You swing across with the flame tongue dagger.
As it backs up, you put another gash across the front of its neck and chest area.
It reels back, looking at you with deep fury.
You feel this incoming pressure, this horrible force of retribution coming to your mind.
You brace for it.
You see its mouth opens up with frustration and anger, its tentacles curl back.
You plunge the blade squarely into that maw. 
You feel the scraping of its teeth across your knuckles, but it doesn't matter, because whatever anger and light was once in its face, goes dark and dull.

Go ahead and make a strength check.

With your hand inside, you pull back and fire, knowing which barrel is next.
You hear this dull booming sound, and its eyes pulse in intense fury and pain.

It shakes its head, lifting you about a foot off the ground.
Painful, but you think it's worth the deal.
Well done.

Scanlan spills out of its mouth, hitting the ground with a dull thud.
As its mouth is now open, it kind of rears back.
You shake your head angrily, as the froth is gathering at the corners of your mouth.
You drop your ax from one hand, grab the jaw, reach in, bite down on its giant meaty tongue.
Using your hand at the back of it, you pull and yank.
You feel the muscle tearing slowly, before it rips free.
And you pull out 30 pounds of wet tongue meat.
