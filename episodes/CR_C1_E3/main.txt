-scene Introduction
-speak Matt  
Hey, everyone, and welcome to the third episode of Critical Role!
-narrate
Travis is wearing a pair of crossed out sunglasses, chilling as brain-dead Grog.
-continue
Let's dive straight in.
So, last we left off, in a subterranean cavern with a deep underground river flowing through it.
You managed to survive a conflict with two umber hulks, thanks to Polymorph and some good tactics.
However, Grog then charged headlong towards a light source, walking straight into an ambush set by duergar.
And an intellect devourer made him brain-dead.
-speak Laura  
He's got nobody to blame but himself.
-speak Matt  
Grog owns it, you can see by his glasses.
-speak Marisha  
I love those.
-speak Matt  
We're beginning now as Grog has collapsed, face down on the ground, drooling.
-speak Liam  
The future's so bright.
-speak Travis  
Somebody pretty give me CPR.
-speak Laura  
Don't talk.
-speak Travis  
Okay.
-speak Scanlan  
Grog! Grog, can you hear us?
Can you feel us near you?
-speak Laura  
I rush down and slap him on the face a few times.
-speak Matt    
You slap him.
-speak Sam  
Nothing?
-speak Matt  
No response.
-speak Scanlan  
Someone, quick! Draw a dick on his face!
-speak Marisha  
I also bend down and slap him a few times.
-speak Keyleth  
I knew it wouldn't work.
I just– Dammit, Grog!
-speak Taliesin  
I'm going to actually try a crude medical examination to see if I can–
19.
-speak Travis  
You leave my prostate alone.
-speak Taliesin  
After I palpate the region.
-speak Matt  
A thorough goliath cavity search later–
You find some stray gold pieces.
-speak Liam  
There's where that pony went!
-speak Taliesin  
That's a very deep belly button you have there, my god!
-speak Matt  
The goliath physicality's a little difficult.
-speak Liam  
Found the troll dick!
-speak Matt 
Looking over him, and there's very little physical damage to him.
There's nothing notable other than the fact that his eyes aren't reacting to anything.
He looks catatonic.
-speak Taliesin 
No bleeding from the ear? From the nose?
-speak Matt 
Nope.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to go take a look at the remnants of the brain creature.
-speak Matt 
Its tougher than you'd expect, but very similar to gray matter in appearance and texture.
Other than these strange, kind of reddish-brown bestial legs.
The whole texture seems very slimy and rubbery.
-speak Laura 
Ew.
-speak Matt 
And it's much larger than any natural brain should be.
About the size of a small dog.
-speak Laura 
Do any of us know anything about magic that could heal him?
Like any spells.
-speak Matt 
Do you?
-speak Laura 
I mean–
-speak Marisha 
I think I might.
-speak Keyleth 
I think I have a spell. That might be able to help.
I don't know it right now though. We'd have to take a break.
I'd have to pull out my books and relearn it.
It takes some time.
-speak Vax 
How much time do you need?
-speak Keyleth 
I'd need to sleep on it.
-speak Travis 
As they talk, Grog slowly flatulates.
-speak Scanlan 
It happens, it's natural.
-speak Matt 
It's terrible.
-speak Vex 
Another ass cloud?
Lovely.
-speak Liam 
Everybody make a constitution saving throw.
-speak Vex 
Well, maybe we should sleep.
Try to camp-
-speak Scanlan 
Well, we'll need to form a perimeter and someone will have to stand guard–
-speak Matt 
Well, currently you're holding a barely alive duergar hostage.
-speak Laura 
Oh! Right!
I forgot about that!
-speak Sam 
Oh, we gotta interrogate.
-speak Laura 
We gotta interrogate her.
And I can speak her language.
-speak Matt 
She is female, and it takes a moment to register that because she is also bald on top.
Nasty, pale, kind of sunken face.
Eyes are completely clouded over and white, no pupils.
Teeth are kind of yellow and gnarled and sharp.
-speak Scanlan 
This creature is very injured.
I think we need to heal her just enough–
-speak Vex 
Heal her?
-speak Scanlan 
Just enough.
-speak Vax 
Not so fast, not so fast.
-speak Vex 
We'll heal her after she talks.
-speak Scanlan 
Why don't you make that bargain then–
-speak Liam 
I put a dagger to her throat, and get an arm around the top of her forehead in a lock.
-narrate 
Matt hisses as the duergar woman.
-speak Vex 
Don't kill her.
I need her.
-speak Matt 
She's got a huge shoulder wound.
-speak Vex 
What did you do to our friend?
-speak duergar Woman  
I didn't do anything. That was the brain's work.
He's gone now. He's all dead inside.
Kaputski.
-speak Vex 
What are you here for?
-speak duergar Woman  
Just creating a mess.
-speak Vex 
What should I fucking ask her?
-speak Percy 
How do we fix it?
-speak Vex 
How do we– 
-narrate 
Laura lowers her voice to try be more intimidating.
-continue 
How do we fix it?
-speak Percy 
There you go.
-speak duergar Woman  
Bury your dead weight.
-scene set2
-speak Liam 
I press the blade a little tighter.
-speak duergar Woman  
Gah!
-speak Liam 
Dig in. Maybe one hit point worth of–
-speak Laura 
No, no! She's only got one hit point left.
-speak Liam 
She's only got one?
-speak Matt 
She's got one hit point.
-speak Taliesin 
Is she bleeding?
-speak Matt 
Profusely, from the shoulder.
-speak Taliesin 
In that case, I'm going to cauterize the wounds.
-speak Percy 
There's more than one way to make someone talk!
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to shoot my gun off– get it nice and hot right at the tip and start cauterizing the wounds.
-speak Matt 
You shoot.
The sound of the blast echoes throughout the entirety of the cavern.
You can hear it cascade off.
-narrate
Marisha covers her ears.
-speak Keyleth 
A little warning next time!
-speak Matt 
You take the barrel, slam it into her shoulder.
You hear this sizzling sound as she rears back in pain.
Make an intimidation check.
-speak Taliesin 
21.
-speak Percy 
Look, we haven't got all day.
How do we fix it–
-speak Vex 
Who do you work for?
-speak Percy 
And who do you work for?
-speak duergar Woman  
You fell, surface-slime.
You've already fallen, and the Master's gathered the sheep.
You shall all be harvested for K'varn!
-speak Vex 
Who is K'varn? Does anybody know?
-speak Scanlan 
No, is that a thing? Is that a person?
-speak Vex 
I don't know.
-speak Taliesin 
Can I roll history on that or is that–?
-speak Vex 
Who is K'varn?
-speak Matt 
You can roll history, if you like.
-speak duergar Woman  
K'varn is the one that rules these caverns.
The one who guides us to take the surface back!
-speak Vex 
To take the surface back?
-speak Taliesin 
A 14 in history wouldn't do anything?
-speak Matt 
No.
-speak Vex 
Is K'varn the one making creepy zombie monsters?
-speak duergar Woman  
K'varn likes to tinker with the fleshlings, yes.
-speak Vex 
Where is K'varn located?
Point the direction.
-speak Matt 
She looks over her shoulder back towards the darker part of the cavern where you guys haven't traversed.
-speak duergar Woman  
Deep. Deep.
-speak Scanlan 
What is K'varn?
-speak Vex 
What. Is. K'varn?
-speak duergar Woman  
You'll see.
-speak Vex 
No, you'll tell me now.
-speak Laura 
I slap her across the face.
-speak duergar Woman  
Argh!
-speak Laura 
Lightly!
Not enough to make her lose a hit point.
-speak Marisha 
It's like a Three Stooges act.
-speak duergar Woman  
My life is already forfeit.
I'm just relishing your faces, for they will be gnarled and twisted soon enough!
-speak Vex 
Break her legs. Leave her here.
Heal her. And let her lay there.
Is that evil? That's pretty evil.
-speak Travis 
I mean–
-speak Keyleth 
Ask her if she's seen Nostoc. Or if they've seen-
Our paladin friend.
-speak Percy 
Lady Kima.
-speak Keyleth 
Lady Kima!
-speak Vex 
Before we end your life, tell us, have you seen a small halfling?
-speak Matt 
You see a moment of recognition in the female duergar's face.
-speak duergar Woman  
There was a halfling, aye.
She was foolish enough to come down here alone.
She's dead now.
We've taken her life and it was delicious.
-speak Liam 
I drag her to her feet, walk her over to the edge of the cliff where the water is, and hold her.
Knife still at her neck.
-speak Vax 
Tell her this-
Now's her last chance to give us anything useful to lead to her boss, I guess.
-speak Vex 
It's your last chance.
Give us something useful, and we'll end this painlessly.
Don't, and we'll make you suffer.
-speak Matt 
Make an intimidation check.
-speak Laura 
Ooh! C'mon, baby!
-speak Liam 
I'm going to assist her by taking my other dagger and letting it drip poison down the blade.
-speak Matt 
So, roll with advantage.
-speak Laura 
Intimidation of 14.
-speak Matt 
She laughs and says: 
-speak duergar Woman  
Your friend's dead!
All is lost! You came for nothing!
-speak Sam 
Can I tell if she's lying?
-speak Matt 
Make an insight check.
-speak Sam 
Insight check? Nope.
-speak Laura 
Okay, can I see if she's lying?
-speak Matt 
You can also make an insight check as well.
-speak Laura 
24!
-speak Matt 
She is definitively lying through her teeth.
Just to hurt you.
-speak Laura 
We know you're lying!
-speak duergar Woman  
Regardless, we have her. She's down below.
And, soon enough, you'll see.
You'll see what shall become of this halfling.
-speak Vex 
We'll rescue her!
And we're going to kill your god!
-narrate
Laura looks at Liam, but Liam hesitates for a second to see if Matt replies.
-narrate
There's an awkward, indecisive pause, before Liam mimes slitting the duergar woman's throat.
-speak Liam 
I did it, I did it.
-speak Matt 
An ichor spray comes across.
-speak Scanlan 
Ugh!
-speak Vex 
That was the worst thing.
-speak Percy 
The most awkward throat-slitting I've ever heard of.
-speak Scanlan 
That was very fast.
-speak Keyleth 
We're going to kill your god.
Wait.
Fuck it, just go with it!
Commit!
-hide duergar
-speak Matt 
As the body goes limp in your hands, you kinda let it tumble over the waterfall.
You guys are now standing over Grog in this kind of makeshift camp site.
-speak Laura 
I'm going to keep watch. With Trinket.
-speak Marisha 
Do we have any idea what time it is?
-speak Matt 
It's at some point in the evening.
-speak Scanlan 
Let's rest.
Let's set up a perimeter and take turns standing guard.
-speak Sam 
I'm going to go to the next cavern over to where we killed those umber hulks?
Take one of the umber hulk heads and put it on a stick.
Right out front of where we're– Of where we're camping as sort of a warning to others.
-speak Marisha 
I'm gonna take the first watch–
I still have a lot of reading to do.
And I want to cast Anti-Life shell as well.
-speak Laura 
Wait, I want to check the bodies of the other guys.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make an investigative check.
-speak Laura 
A 20?
-speak Matt 
Okay.
Glancing about, you pull roughly 125 gold pieces between the three corpses of the duergar.
-scene set3
-continue 
Well, two corpses because one of them is gone.
It washed downstream.
-speak Liam 
She had all the good things.
-speak Matt 
You do, however, find on one of them a gnarled implement of some kind.
It's of a strange, like almost bleached bone ivory that comes to a point at one end.
-speak Sam 
Ooh. Let's look at it.
-speak Matt 
It's pretty.
-speak Vex 
Ooh, let me see, let me see.
-speak Sam 
Can I take a look at it and–
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and roll arcana.
-speak Sam 
Arcana. 24.
-narrate 
Matt hands a sheet over to Sam.
-speak Scanlan 
Wonderful! A Wand of Magic Missiles.
-speak Vex 
What! Awesome!
-speak Keyleth 
It goes pew pew!
-speak Vex 
I'm glad we killed them before they used that on us.
-speak Percy 
It's a pew pew stick.
-speak Matt 
Scanlan, you go ahead and you eventually find one of the corpses of the umber hulk.
It takes you a good 25 minutes to eventually carve through its thick, chitinous exterior.
You put the head on a makeshift spike, and it is now there on display.
-speak Sam 
Yes, as a warning to others.
-speak Matt 
You feel accomplished.
-speak Taliesin 
Terrible taxidermy attempt.
-speak Matt 
Keyleth, you cast Anti-Life shell.
As you take first watch, you notice a couple of things.
This campsite has been here for a while, and it looks like the duergar repurposed it.
The stone that are set up around the fire pit have been there for quite some time, and are set up very uniformly.
Right above you, on one of the stone walls, you see what appears to be a strange, very well carved symbol.
Go ahead and make a religion check.
-speak Laura 
Oh, man.
-speak Marisha 
Ugh, wish Pike were here.
-speak Liam 
Yes, we wish Pike was here.
-speak Laura 
Pike's missing everything!
-speak Taliesin 
Very much.
-speak Liam 
Come back, little gnome!
-speak Marisha 
Religion is an 8.
-speak Matt 
It's just a really interesting carving on the wall.
-speak Keyleth 
So pretty!
-speak Matt 
It's fresh, it's not like an ancient symbol.
It's been there about a week or two.
-speak Marisha 
I go ahead and I take a piece of paper from my spellbook, and I take a piece of charcoal, and I just scroll over top of it.
To get an imprint of it.
-speak Matt 
It's very big.
It's like four feet by three feet.
-speak Marisha 
I take a few pieces of paper, and I kind of glue them together to get a really big one.
-speak Matt 
All right.
First hour passes without any issue. Anti-Life Shell fades.
-speak Laura 
Vax and I take the next watch.
-speak Matt 
The next few hours go by without incident.
-speak Laura 
That's nice.
I'm not gonna wander off, but I want to look around for anything interesting.
-speak Matt 
Well, there's a lot of mineral deposits.
You also catch the strange carved symbol right atop your guys' camp.
-speak Laura 
I tap my brother and go:
-speak Vex 
Look at this.
Do you know anything about religion?
-speak Vax 
Well, let me see.
-speak Vex 
Let me see.
-speak Liam 
Well, I seem to know fuck-all about it.
10.
-speak Laura 
Oh, me too!
I know shit about it.
-speak Matt 
It's a very fancy symbol.
-speak Vex 
It's a really pretty symbol.
-speak Matt 
You guys finish your watch–
-speak Vax 
I really wish Pike was here.
-speak Marisha 
Just, the party is taking turns being like, so pretty!
-speak Laura 
I know!
-speak Sam 
Where was that symbol?
-speak Matt 
It's on one of the large cave surfaces near where you guys are camping.
-speak Laura 
I don't see any cool sparkly things in the mineral deposits?
None of that?
-speak Matt 
Nothing catches your attention.
-speak Laura 
Damn it!
-speak Liam 
All about the bling.
-speak Laura 
I am about the bling.
-speak Marisha 
How's it going over there, Grog?
-narrate 
Travis laughs a little, and continues sipping from his mug with a straw.
-speak Matt 
You finish your watch without issue.
Who's taking the final watch?
-speak Sam 
I'll do it.
-speak Taliesin 
I'll take it as well.
-speak Matt 
Okay. You both keep watch.
Occasionally you have to adjust Grog, because you're not sure if he's still breathing.
-speak Travis 
What!?
-speak Sam 
Not sure if he's still breathing?
-speak Laura 
Oh my god, what if you could die while we're sleeping?
-narrate 
Travis doesn't respond.
-speak Taliesin 
Do I recognize the carving?
-speak Matt 
Make a religion check.
-speak Taliesin 
20.
-speak Matt 
You are familiar with this symbol.
That is the symbol of Bahamut.
It is the symbol of the Platinum Dragon.
-speak Laura 
Oh!
-speak Matt 
And it was probably used as part of some sort of protection ritual.
-speak Percy  
Lady Kima left this. This must have been her camp.
-speak Matt 
As you are having this discussion, you feel a slight rumble in the ground.
-speak Travis 
Fucked up now.
-speak Marisha 
Oh no.
-speak Matt 
Some of the rocks nearby, the loose pebbles, begin to vibrate and move around.
-speak Scanlan 
Grog's probably farting again.
-speak Percy  
No, I don't think– I think we should alert the others.
-speak Scanlan 
All right.
-speak Laura 
We're waking up, we're waking up.
Don't worry, we are gonna heal you.
-speak Sam 
Let's quietly wake them, and I will go peer into the darkness and see if I can see them.
-speak Taliesin 
Let's wake everybody up, and then we'll get to work–
Is all this going at the same time?
-speak Sam 
Is the rumbling continuous, or is it just one little rumble?
-speak Matt 
A few moments pass, the rumbling has subsided.
-speak Sam 
Oh, okay.
-speak Laura 
So we're awake.
Let's heal this guy. Can you heal him?
-speak Marisha 
Am I awake? Are we awake?
Did you wake me up?
-speak Matt 
Okay, you all wake up–
-speak Vex 
Ah, that was a good nap!
-speak Keyleth 
Ugh.
-speak Vex 
I think Grog farted again.
-speak Scanlan 
Something terrible is brewing.
-speak Vex 
Keyleth– no, what?
-speak Scanlan 
There was a rumble.
-speak Keyleth 
Okay, do we wanna stay here?
Do we wanna do this here?
-speak Vex 
Yeah! Do it here!
-speak Percy 
Do this here.
-speak Vex 
How long will this take, Keyleth?
-speak Keyleth 
I don't know. But I want us to be as safe as we can.
-speak Sam 
Are you gonna cast a spell now?
-speak Marisha 
We're gonna do this.
-speak Sam 
Okay, I'd like to give her a little inspirational song.
-speak Keyleth 
Scanlan, give me some nice meditation, some–
-speak Scanlan 
Okay, some, like, yoga music?
-speak Keyleth 
Yes!
Some, like, pure moods.
-speak Laura 
Trinket gives her a massage beforehand to loosen her up.
-narrate
To the tune of "True" by Spandeau Ballet:
-speak Scanlan 
~Ah ha ha haaaaa~
~You know, you, got to cure Grog.~
-speak Marisha 
I go ahead and light some incense.
-speak Keyleth 
Scanlan, do you still have that deity, that little idol of Pike?
-speak Scanlan 
I do have my idol of Pike, yes!
-speak Keyleth 
Can we just have that out just so I have her energy.
-speak Scanlan 
Oh, of course!
-speak Keyleth 
Just feel like I need her.
-speak Sam 
I take out the idol of Pike that I keep always close to my loins.
And I hold it tightly, and caress it a little.
-speak Matt 
This distracts you for a minute, Keyleth, but eventually you move on.
You take a bit of earth from a pouch, earth from your home tribe where you grew up.
You scattered some of it around Grog, who is now laid on his back, arms and legs stretched out.
-speak Travis 
Naked.
-speak Matt 
No. You're still clothed.
-speak Marisha 
Let's not go there. No need to be naked.
-speak Matt 
As this is the first time you've attempted a magic of this type, you close your eyes and take in the earth's essence.
As a druid, being connected to nature is where you draw your divine energy.
-speak Marisha 
I'm so nervous.
-speak Matt 
You take from the vibration that you felt.
And come in tune with the way the earth, the planet itself, shifts and moves.
-speak Vax 
You got this, Keyleth!
-speak Vex 
You can do this Keyleth!
-speak Keyleth 
I'm literally shaking.
-speak Matt 
You use that to give strength to the physical form of Grog in hopes of restoring him.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, I just kind of lay my hands on his forehead.
-speak Vex 
Oh my gosh!
-speak Scanlan 
You know, I know Grog very well, and he might enjoy, or be inspired by, a kiss of a female.
I'm just saying, just the gentle kiss of a female lips on his might rouse him.
I've seen it many times.
Vex? Get in there!
-narrate 
Laura leans in to kiss Travis, but he stays sitting back with his arms crossed, and she has to lean a little farther than is comfortable.
-speak Matt 
As Vex awkwardly fumbles over the the overtly sized goliath-
-speak Vex 
I think it helped.
-narrate 
Travis mimes an erection with his hand.
-speak Laura 
Stop it.
-speak Travis 
Not all dead.
-speak Liam 
Just upstairs.
-speak Marisha 
Do I get an inspiration die from Scanlan?
-speak Matt 
You do, yes. Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier.
-speak Laura 
Do I get to assist since I gave him a kiss?
-speak Matt 
No assistance on this.
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
-speak Sam 
Let's do this, man.
-speak Liam 
Save Grog!
-speak Laura 
Save Grog. Save Grog!
-speak Marisha 
Gah. Nauseous.
No!
-speak Matt 
What'd you roll?
-speak Laura 
No!
-speak Marisha 
Where's the inspiration die?
It's a d8, right?
-speak Matt 
It's a d8.
-speak Marisha 
Do I get advantage on this, since I'm taking time?
-speak Matt 
As is, yes, yeah, you have advantage on the roll, yeah!
-speak Marisha 
I do have advantage on this?
-speak Laura 
Come on, Keyleth!
Keyleth, Keyleth, Keyleth!
-speak Marisha 
Oh, that's much better!
-speak Laura 
What? What was it?
-speak Marisha 
I'm still gonna do the inspiration dice, just in casies.
Okay, that's good.
-speak Taliesin 
That's good.
-speak Matt 
What's the total?
-speak Marisha 
29!
-speak Taliesin 
Oh my god.
-speak Matt 
You complete the ritual.
There's a brief glow.
-speak Marisha 
Ah, I'm still shaking.
-speak Matt 
You see Grog take in a deeper breath.
His chest expands.
His eyes, which currently stare off in space, begin to clarify, and his brow quivers for a second.
And you see a little bit of life return to his face.

Grog?
-speak Matt 
Grog, your sight focuses as the party is gathered around you.
Looking down upon your currently stretched out physical form in a cavern.
You're very confused.
-scene set4
-speak Vax 
Welcome back, big guy.
-speak Grog 
I thought I was in algebra class again for a second there.
-speak Keyleth 
Grog!
-speak Scanlan 
You're alive!
-speak Vex 
Good job, Keyleth!
-speak Grog 
Sorry, who woke me up from my sleep?
Keyleth? 
-speak Travis 
I run over and I give Keyleth a big ol' bear hug, squeezing maybe a bit too tight.
-speak Keyleth 
Ow.
-speak Laura 
I think he shit himself while he was unconscious, so that's gotta smell really wonderful.
-speak Travis 
I smell better than I ever have before.
-speak Keyleth 
Just glad you're all right, Grog.
Really glad you're awake.
-speak Travis 
I reach into the bag of holding and I get the cask of ale and my goblet, and I pour a little goblet of ale and I give it to Keyleth.
-speak Keyleth 
To Grog!
-speak Everyone
To Grog!
-speak Grog 
To me!
-speak Travis 
I'm so glad you had advantage on that.
-speak Scanlan 
Grog, how are you feeling?
-speak Grog 
My intelligence is–
-speak Travis
What is it now?
-speak Matt 
It's back to normal.
-speak Grog 
It's 6, so–
-speak Scanlan 
Right where it should be.
-speak Grog 
I feel right as rain.
What are we killing?
-speak Vax 
Brains, apparently.
-speak Scanlan 
How many fingers is this?
-narrate 
Sam holds up two fingers.
-speak Grog 
Three.
-speak Scanlan 
Perfect.
-speak Keyleth 
Good, he's back, you guys.
He's back.
-speak Grog 
Blue.
Oh no, hold on.
-speak Keyleth 
Good.
-speak Grog 
Square!
-speak Scanlan  
Keyleth, that was very impressive.
-speak Keyleth 
Oh, thank you.
I had Pike in mind. I channeled her energy.
-speak Scanlan 
It's true, it was quite astounding.
I have a little chub on.
-narrate 
Laura groans.
-speak Grog 
So do I, for some reason.
-speak Vex 
You're welcome.
-speak Keyleth 
Yeah well, that's a bit of a side effect.
-speak Grog 
It must be the morning.
-speak Keyleth 
That's part of the Greater Restoration, a few things get restored.
-speak Grog 
God bless you.
-speak Vax 
Do you remember anything about a kiss in your dreams while you were asleep?
-speak Grog 
Well, my cheeks are sort of sore for some reason, as if they've been slapped repeatedly by a bunch of twats.
And then I've got this one little wet mark right here where I got a kiss and it smells like half-elvish spit.
-speak Vax 
Oh, that was Trinket.
Trinket helped with the spell.
Gave you a kiss and helped wake you up.
-speak Vex 
Oh, why didn't I have Trinket–
-speak Percy 
And several slaps.
-speak Matt 
At which point you look over and Trinket is there off to the side, notably excited that you're moving again.
-speak Vex 
Aw.
-speak Matt 
Comes over and nuzzles up against you for a moment.
-speak Grog 
Oh Trinket, you big ol' furball.
-speak Travis 
Trinket noogie!
-speak Grog 
Can we go kill something now?
-speak Vex 
Well shit, I guess we should.
I think we are all healed up.
-speak Matt 
You guys all healed overnight.
-speak Laura 
Did he heal while he was unconscious?
-speak Matt 
No, unfortunately.
-speak Scanlan 
Let's do some Grog healing.
-speak Sam 
Do you have healing dice for a short rest?
-speak Travis 
I do.
-speak Sam 
I'm gonna sing a song of rest for you, so that'll add 1d6 to your healing rolls.
-speak Travis 
Great. I'm back up to full.
-speak Scanlan 
Shall we tarry on, everyone?
-speak Vax 
Yes, I have a feeling these tunnels are going to suck majorly, but we have nowhere to go but down, so–
-speak Laura 
Which which tunnel did she point towards?
-speak Matt 
She pointed towards the rest of the cavern, which you have just stepped into.
-speak Laura 
Can I use tracking? Not just for where most of the tracks go, but the halfling, Kima, her tracks.
-speak Matt 
Lady Kima.
Go ahead and make a survival check.
-speak Laura 
With advantage, since we're in the Underdark?
-speak Matt 
This is technically considered the crust of the Underdark.
-speak Laura 
19.
-speak Matt 
You pay attention to the cavern floor as you begin to move further down.
The first thing you notice is there are definitive signs of running back towards where you're coming from.
Some of them appear to be more recent than others.
You notice a few decomposing corpses of various goblinoid creatures.
Two goblins, cut open. Some of the, the skin is pulled tight against the bone from the rot.
Not a great smell.
There are more signs of struggle as you progress.
You find some drag marks that are similar to what you saw back in the mines.
-background kraghammer
-continue 
And as you move forward and the tunnel begins to open up, you can see small pockets of that red stone that's used to light a bunch of Kraghammer.
Embedded in the walls of the cavern ahead and just faintly giving this reddish glow.
And then, 60 feet ahead of you, you notice a series of huts.
Small stone structures cobbled together.
Small buildings made of riftwood and other scavenged materials.
It's a very kinda ramshackle village.
-speak Scanlan 
Let's burn it down.
-speak Liam 
I am stealthing.
-speak Laura 
Oh, okay, I'm gonna stealth too.
-speak Liam 
Natural 20.
-speak Marisha 
Woo!
-speak Laura 
Oh, that one didn't really count.
-speak Liam 
Just roll on your phone a couple times and then off to the side.
-speak Laura 
They all sucked, so.
-speak Liam 
And you said that the red crystals on the wall are glowing somewhat?
-speak Matt 
Yeah, these naturally occuring red crystals.
-speak Liam 
Enough to give the half-elves vision in low light?
-speak Matt 
Only if you're close enough, you're still dependant on your torches.
There aren't any crystals in the village.
-speak Taliesin 
Are there any signs of life?
-speak Matt 
You don't see any movement.
-speak Liam 
I am starting to creep towards the nearest building and press up against the wall. I'm just going to listen.
-speak Laura 
I rolled a 16, is that enough to actually stealth?
-speak Matt 
That's up to you.
-speak Laura 
No.
-speak Matt 
Vax, you get to the outskirts.
You can now see, a number of the buildings and huts have been smashed or destroyed.
More and more of these goblin corpses strewn across the ground.
Some of these tents seem to have rags or something stuffed into them.
There's two goblins near you, slashed open.
-speak Liam 
None of them alive, that I can tell?
-speak Matt 
Nope.
-speak Liam 
I can't see any movement anywhere?
-speak Matt 
Not from this perspective. It's pretty dark.
-speak Liam 
I'll use my earring:
-speak Vax 
I think we're in the clear.
-speak Laura 
We follow him.
-speak Matt 
You guys approach slowly, you can see more with the torches.
There's a multitude of goblin bodies strewn about this village.
There are actually piles of corpses stuffed into some of these huts.
Corpses that aren't goblin.
A few dwarven bodies piled up on the side.
Some of them are partially eaten. Like they have been stripped for meat.
-scene set5
-speak Vex 
Ew.
-speak Grog 
What?
-speak Matt 
Make an investigation check.
-speak Laura 
24.
-speak Liam 
22.
-speak Matt 
As you look through the buildings, there are piles of bone, sinew, and metal.
The dwarven bodies are mostly entirely decomposed, what remnants have not been stripped off it for food.
-speak Liam 
Anything useful in the pile?
-speak Matt 
One of the dwarves has a set of very very finely crafted leather armor, but it looks in pretty bad condition.
Vex, you notice a number of the goblin corpses have a uniform wound.
This terrible puncture wound in the skull.
-speak Vex 
Oh no.
-speak Matt 
Just an opening wound about an inch and a half wide.
-speak Vex 
You didn't notice that, that's how unperceptive you are.
-speak Vax 
My sister, everybody.
-speak Matt 
And for each one of these wounds, there's nothing left inside in the skull.
-speak Vex 
It sucked their brains out.
Whatever it was.
-speak Matt 
It's very possible.
-speak Grog 
I know what that feels like.
Did you put your finger in the hole?
-speak Laura 
I'm going to put my finger in the hole.
-speak Matt 
Your finger goes inside, you reach around.
There is some brain matter within there.
But not much, and its very gelatinous.
-speak Travis 
Oatmeal.
-speak Matt 
Partially decomposed, almost like a slime.
But sure enough, mostly vacant.
-speak Vex 
Lovely.
-speak Scanlan 
What's going on, guys?
-speak Vex 
Brain suckers, something that sucks brains.
-speak Scanlan 
As long as they are sucking it out of goblins, I'm good with that.
-speak Vax 
My sister doesn't remember, but one of our instructors in Syngorn used to tell us of a creature, I'm not sure what they're called, but–
-speak Vex 
I don't think I was in that class, actually.
-speak Vax 
A creature that steals its victims' minds and digests them, reaches right in and takes them out.
-speak Grog 
Like that brain on legs?
-speak Vax 
I think it's much worse.
I think the brain was a scout or some sort of pet.
-speak Keyleth 
We also have this K'varn, who is experimenting on all those creatures, so we can't even attest for any of this.
-speak Percy 
It could just be parts of one.
-speak Keyleth 
A hodge-podge of everything.
-speak Percy 
A dragon with a goblin brain.
-narrate 
Laura gasps.
-speak Vex 
What if K'varn is a dragon?
The symbol, the dragon symbol-
-speak Percy 
Kima drew that. It's some kind of protection symbol from her god.
-speak Vex 
Oh. So it was a good symbol?
-speak Matt 
You recall that Lady Kima was, specifically, a paladin of Bahamut.
-speak Laura 
Oh!
-speak Vax 
I just think we should proceed with caution.
Our teachers spoke about this thing, said that it was a being of the mind.
I think our trouble with Grog could just be the beginning.
We need to proceed very carefully.
-speak Vex 
Oh no!
-speak Scanlan 
All we can do is keep going.
-speak Matt 
So you leave behind the pile of dwarven corpses, the goblin corpses with the wounds.
Leaving the leather armor behind?
-speak Laura 
Oh well, I thought you said it was ruined?
-speak Liam 
And it was dwarf-sized.
-speak Matt 
No, it would be nasty pulling it off a corpse.
-speak Laura 
Oh, well then, fuck it.
Let's pull it off.
-speak Liam 
Isn't it dwarf-sized? Or does armor also shrink and expand?
-speak Laura 
It's magical. Possibly.
-speak Laura 
I take it.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so you shake off the-
-speak Laura 
All the goo.
-speak Matt 
The remains of the dwarven corpse.
It just falls off out of the armor.
-speak Liam 
It's like pulled pork.
-speak Laura 
Mm.
-speak Matt 
It does have a magical aura.
-speak Laura 
Oooh.
-speak Matt 
Make an arcana check.
-speak Sam 
20 arcana.
-speak Matt 
It appears to be a simple but powerful enchantment.
It is a pair of studded leather armor with a plus two enchantment.
-speak Liam 
If I try to pull on the sleeve, does it come up to my elbow or does it stretch out and fit?
-speak Matt 
It comes up to your elbow and then, given a moment, it fits to your form.
-speak Laura 
Ooh, yeah!
-speak Vax 
That's nice.
I'll take this, hold on. Thank you.
-speak Liam 
I go into the smelly corpse hut and start to change my armor.
-speak Vex 
What did you get? Let me see that.
-speak Sam 
So wait, does he get a higher AC?
What is that?
-speak Laura 
Yeah, so he just took it.
-speak Sam 
I'll take it!
-speak Laura 
Good luck with that.
-speak Vax 
Once you've got the dwarf gunk off, it's rather nice.
-speak Vex 
Oh yeah?
-speak Vax 
Yes, it's supple.
-speak Scanlan 
All right, shall we keep on keeping on?
-speak Matt 
You guys keep pushing forward.
You press through the goblin ghost town.
-speak Laura 
I'm still tracking, looking for anything interesting.
-speak Matt 
You catch, off in the distance, another faint moving light source.
-speak Vex 
Oh shit!
-speak Matt 
Everyone roll a stealth check.
-speak Laura 
Natural 20!
-speak Liam 
30.
-speak Marisha 
15.
-speak Sam 
20.
-speak Taliesin 
12.
-speak Travis 
6?
-speak Matt 
Okay, as you all buckle down and be as quiet as you can–
-speak Laura 
You rolled a six?
-speak Sam 
Grog rolled a six.
-speak Liam 
Stay put, you asshole.
-speak Matt 
It's a group check, so as long as the majority of you succeed, the group succeeds.
-speak Travis 
Yay, bell curve.
-speak Matt 
So you seem to be comfortable in the stillness of the moment.
Best you can see in the distance, you see figures shifting, moving away from you.
Many figures.
A group of humanoid figures, moving steadily away from you.
-speak Laura 
Can we scout ahead?
We're both really super stealth, can we like–
-speak Liam 
Yeah, we're gonna start kinda quickly dash after them.
-speak Matt 
Yeah, using your same stealth rolls, you push forward.
Past the outskirts of the goblin village, you see a large cliff.
-slowbackground black
-continue 
The actual surface here comes to a very direct end and seems to just disappear into a dark abyss.
There is a singular, ten-foot-wide rope bridge, that is bolted into the side of this cliff.
It stretches out across this giant crevasse, for what– you can't see the other side.
-speak Travis 
Awesome!
-speak Laura 
This feels like The Descent, I don't like this, you guys.
-scene set6
-speak Matt 
It very much has that kind of a feel.
It just goes on a for a good 60, 70 feet, and then darkness.
And you can see what looks to be a cluster of about 12 to 13 duergar.
-show duergar 3
-showanother duergar 6
-showanother duergar 9
-speak Laura 
Oh no.
-speak Matt 
They're making their way in lines of two across this bridge.
-show dwarfman2 4.5
-show dwarfman3 7.5
-refresh duergar
-continue 
Amongst them, they have, chained up, three dwarf miners that they are also dragging across the bridge.
-speak Scanlan 
We have to save those ones.
-speak Grog 
Just cut the bridge.
-speak Scanlan 
No, no!
-speak Laura 
What do the miners look like?
Are they docile, do they seem to be fighting back?
-speak Matt 
They don't appear to be putting up much of a fight.
In their current circumstance.
-speak Liam 
How wide is the bridge?
-speak Matt 
Ten feet.
-speak Liam 
That means two people wide.
-speak Laura 
Grog goes by himself.
-speak Liam 
But if we go out there, it's going to be close combat.
You can't get to the ones at the back.
-speak Travis 
We have a flying carpet.
-speak Laura 
I mean, how many are there?
-speak Matt 
From what you can see it looks about 12-ish.
-speak Laura 
And they have a light source with them so we can definitely see them?
-speak Matt 
They do, it's a very faint light.
A lantern made from a small clump of the red crystal.
-speak Vex 
We have two options.
We can fight them. Or follow them.
-speak Grog 
Follow.
-speak Vex 
I think we follow them.
-speak Scanlan 
If we follow them on the bridge, won't they feel it bouncing?
-speak Vex 
We gotta wait until they cross it.
-speak Scanlan 
We can't see the end of it.
-speak Marisha 
How suspicious would a bat be here?
-speak Matt 
Bats generally live in caverns with openings to the outside world, where they do their nocturnal hunting.
This is a very, very deep cavern that does not have easy access to the surface.
-speak Vex 
I've got an idea.
The carpet. Gimme the carpet.
-speak Scanlan 
Just you? You're gonna go on the carpet alone?
-speak Vex 
And Vax. We can both go on the carpet.
-speak Scanlan 
What if something happens?
-speak Vex 
We just gotta see where they're going!
We'll come back and get you.
-speak Scanlan 
I'm coming with you.
-speak Travis 
I give them the carpet, but I also tie the endless rope to it.
-speak Liam 
Now we're a kite.
-speak Matt 
You pull out the carpet and lay it out.
At this point in time, they're a little over halfway across the bridge.
You can see it swaying in a very uncomfortable way.
-speak Vex 
Scanlan, you better be stealthy.
-speak Liam 
I grab Scanlan by the scruff of his neck.
-speak Matt 
The three of you guys hop on, and it's probably big enough for the three of you.
It's about the right size.
-speak Scanlan 
Shotgun!
-hide keyleth
-hide grog
-hide percy
-speak Matt 
The carpet lifts off.
Are you going straight over the bridge or are you taking a side route?
-speak Laura 
Next to the bridge?
-speak Liam 
Side and up. They might look sideways.
-speak Laura 
I think we should go down below the bridge.
-speak Liam 
If you're on a bridge, you're looking down at your feet.
-speak Sam 
Let's go above them.
-speak Laura 
All right, fine, fuck it, go above them.
-speak Matt 
Make a stealth check.
-speak Laura 
I thought we were still stealthed?
-speak Matt 
Maneuvering on a flying carpet is a different type of locomotion.
-speak Sam 
Not great. 13.
-speak Liam 
29.
-speak Laura 
17.
-speak Matt 
Got it.
As you reach the edge of the crevasse, immediately the air itself is warmer.
A strange breeze blowing up from this giant crevasse.
And you look down and see faint light sources.
Long, thin, trickling streams of what looks like molten rock.
-speak Travis 
Shit.
-speak Sam 
Way down below.
-speak Matt 
Way down below.
It's at least a thousand feet down.
-speak Sam 
We don't want to fall.
-speak Matt 
Don't fall, it's very bad.
The air itself has a very sulfurous smell.
It's a little difficult to get enough air at first. You have to get adjusted.
The river that's been cascading through the cavern goes rocketing off the edge and disappears into the darkness below.
You guys push forward, keeping at a safe distance.
You eventually follow them across the crevasse.
And you can see now them entering what looks like a shanty town of tents and small stone structures.
Better built than the goblin village, but it looks like a temporary settlement.
There's a bunch of military tents.
You can see some rudimentary stone buildings, thrown together in a day or two.
Very square, very rigid and dwarven in their design.
More for utility that any sort of visual presentation or beauty.
-speak Vax 
This is a war camp.
-slowbackground kraghammer
-speak Matt 
Lanterns of this red stone are hung up all throughout the village on these giant poles. A little bit of an occasional light source throughout the camp.
-speak Laura 
How big is this camp?
-speak Matt 
You've seen about 30 to 40 duergar moving through, as well as a few larger shapes.
-speak Laura 
Oh, shit.
-speak Matt 
A couple of very large humanoid hulking figures.
-speak Vex 
Oh no.
-speak Vax 
How are we gonna get through this?
-speak Vex 
What are we gonna do?
-speak Scanlan 
The view up here is beautiful!
-speak Laura 
~A whole new world~
We should scout. Or should we go back?
-speak Liam 
We're past the chasm at this point?
-speak Matt 
You're almost reached the camp now, and you're at about the limit of where you're sure they won't see you.
-speak Laura 
What's the cavern itself like?
-speak Matt 
There aren't any side caverns.
It's a pretty smooth cavern, the camp goes up to the cave walls on both sides.
Past the camp, there's a tunnel leading deeper.
-speak Laura 
But they're blocking it.
Under the bridge, are there any openings?
-speak Matt 
Do you want to swoop down and check?
-speak Liam 
Yes.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you swoop down, and the air gets even thicker.
You find yourself kinda taking your cloak and putting it over your mouth just to get the scent out.
The side of the rock surface is well worn down, it looks like it used to be a waterfall.
But the water dried up a long time ago.
There's no openings in the cliff.
-speak Vex 
What are we gonna do?
-speak Scanlan 
Okay, listen.
Leave me behind, I'll follow the party with the hostages, I'll see where they go.
Don't worry, I'll be invisible.
Go back, tell our fellows, get them across the bridge.
And we'll meet here in about an hour.
-scene set7
-speak Travis 
I like it.
-speak Scanlan 
What?
I'm super brave and hung, come on, let's do this.
-speak Vex 
All right, I'm down.
-speak Vax 
All right.
-hide vex
-hide vax 
-speak Laura 
We drop him off.

-speak Sam 
I turn invisible.
-speak Travis 
Scanlan, the best bard!
-speak Sam 
And I'm gonna just hang behind the party that's got the hostage dwarves, and just kinda see where they go.
-speak Travis 
Do you activate hung at the same time?
-speak Sam 
No need to activate.
It's passive.
-speak Marisha 
It's a racial bonus.
-speak Liam 
Once the party we're following clears the bridge, I'm going to set down there and wait.
And over the earring:
-speak Vax 
Scanlan, I'm waiting for you at the bridge, if there's trouble.
-speak Scanlan  
Got it.
-speak Laura 
I guess I'm the only one going back then.
-speak Matt 
Scanlan, go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage.
-speak Travis 
C'mon, buddy.
-speak Sam 
18!
-speak Matt 
You follow the group down what functions as the thoroughfare in the center of this town.
You can see a few duergar coming out and joining the group, inspecting the dwarf miners, speaking in a language you don't understand.
They seem to ask some questions, a couple slap the miners, one spits on them.
The dwarves look pretty broken from the circumstance, but also brimming with anger.
Like true dwarves, they haven't given in to it, they're just biding their time until they can get vengeance.
Two trolls wander out from an alley to join in this now larger group..
-speak Travis 
Yes! Trolls!
-speak Matt 
You've encountered trolls before, but these trolls have pupilless eyes clouded over with white.
The same as the duergar.
-speak Sam 
Ooh! They're slave trolls!
-speak Matt 
As you follow further in, you see two ogres, stationed in the centre square of this encampment.
And both of these ogres also have the same, pupilless, white, glazed-over look to their eyes.
You see some duergar constructing more tents.
Some are forging weaponry.
It definitely feels like a war camp, like they're preparing for something.
There's a raised wooden platform in the centre of the square, about 20 foot wide on each side.
You see a group of six duergar on it that are all wearing very intricate, black iron plate armor.
And they're all just sitting on the outskirts of this platform.
-speak Sam 
White eyes?
-speak Matt 
All the duergar seem to have that look to their eyes as well.
-speak Travis 
Shit.
-speak Sam 
Okay.
-speak Matt 
As the party you've been following enters the center of this vicinity, make another stealth check, with advantage.
-speak Sam 
Gah. 19.
-speak Matt 
A duergar steps out of one of the tents near you, and you just barely manage to pull out of the way without making any sort of squeak or noise.
He goes by.
-speak Travis 
Oh god!
-speak Liam 
Careful, Bilbo!
-speak Matt 
Taking another moment, you notice a large stone building past the other side of this wooden platform.
A makeshift barracks, with a set of double doors that are currently open. 
Two figures step out through them, heading towards the main platform.
-show duergar_general -3
-continue
One of which is a very, very well-decorated duergar.
He's wearing similar blackened plate armor as the other elite guard  onthis platform, but with gold and silver scrolling on it.
A long, tattered, dark purple cape, and has a nasty scar across the cheek that leads into this kind of gnarled, grey beard.
Sheathed across its back in a large scabbard is a gargantuan two-handed sword that should be unwieldy for a creature of its size.
-speak Laura 
We can't fight these guys.
-show mindflayer -5
-refresh duergar_general
-speak Matt 
The figure beside him is very tall and lanky. 
They're dressed in long, black and red robes with a hood obscuring their features.
The tall figure stands roughly two feet behind the main duergar as they both step on to the platform. 
You can see some conversation happening, but you're too far away to really make anything out.
Do you want to move closer?
-speak Sam 
Do I speak their language?
-speak Matt 
Do you speak Undercommon?
-speak Sam 
Nope!
I'm good where I am!
-speak Matt 
This seemingly officious duergar, this general, makes a few gestures and shouts out to those gathered.
Not quite sure, but you get the idea he's giving orders or directions.
The war party then begins to pull the dwarf miners to another section of the camp.
As they do, the tall, lanky figure drifts forward.
You get the sense it isn't walking, somehow.
It lifts a lanky hand, and every single duergar in the vicinity, whatever it was doing, stops in place.
And they all turn and look at it, as one.
-speak Sam 
Whoa.
-speak Matt 
At which point, this creature brings its fingers in a beckoning gesture, loosely in your direction.
-speak Sam 
I'm wearing my ring of mind-shielding, by the way.
-speak Matt 
For a split second, you feel your heart in your throat.
Your entire body stands on pins and needles, as one of the duergar pulls one of the dwarven captives away from the group.
-refresh dwarfman2
-continue
The dwarf doesn't go easy, kind of struggling against being pulled,until it looks over at the figure and its arms suddenly go limp to its side.
And it begins to walk out of its own volition.
Steps onto the platform and approaches this tall, lanky figure with the hood and long robes behind it.
As it does, its hand reaches out and caresses the side of this dwarf's face.
This dwarf seems to have given up all sense of fight or any conflict and just stares up into this darkened hood.
-hide mindflayer

-refresh duergar_general

You see these terrible purple tentacles come writhing out of the front of the creature's hood.
As the hood falls back, you see this horrible smooth, purplish-blue hairless head, these sunken yellowish-green eyes.
The tentacles wrap around the dwarf's head and pull the dwarf into its mouth.
There's a brief struggle, and then the dwarf's arms fall limp to its side.
-hide dwarfman2
-continue 
The tentacles unravel from its head.
The creature pulls back, a bit of ichor and dwarf blood dripping from what looks like a lamprey's toothy maw.
There's a thud as the dwarf falls lifeless to the ground.
-speak Sam 
Poor son of a bitch.
-speak Matt 
A horrible hole bored in its forehead.
The creature then draws its hood back up, and makes a small hand gesture.
All the duergar whip back around and continue whatever they had been doing.

The two remaining dwarven captives look completely stunned, their faces white with fear as they are dragged off.

I think I'll go back to my fellows.
-speak Matt 
Okay, make a stealth check.
-speak Laura 
Oh, god.
-speak Sam 
21.
-speak Matt 
You maneuver your way out back the way you came, best you can.
Go ahead and make a survival check to try navigate.
-speak Sam 
Survival check, so plus zero.
17.
-speak Matt 
You take a moment, orient yourself, looking about the cavern.
This is a very confusing camp, and you paid more attention to what was happening then the path you took.
-speak Sam 
It's like Venice.
-speak Matt 
Kind of, yeah.
You nearly get lost twice, but eventually find your way back to the southern-portion entrance of this war camp.

You see the crevasse, the familiar scent of sulfurous wind billowing out from underneath.

You find Vax, and both of you make the slow journey back across to join the rest of the party.
And that's where we're going to take our break.

Ooh!
-speak Sam 
Whoa.
-speak Marisha 
Holy shit.
What are we going to do?
-speak Travis 
We're gonna fight the shit out of them.

We're going to risk it all.

As we left off, the party had just reconvened on the other side of this gargantuan crevasse in the Underdark.
-speak Scanlan 
And that's when I came back to see you guys.
-speak Grog 
Great.
-speak Percy 
Wonderfully detailed.
-speak Vex 
What are we going to do?
-speak Marisha 
I give Scanlan some water from my waterskin.
-speak Vax 
You are a brave little fellow.
-speak Scanlan 
Thank you.
-speak Vex 
Has anyone come across these creatures before?
These weird tentacle brain guys?
-speak Keyleth 
I've heard rumors of those.
-speak Sam 
Can we make a check for what it is?
-speak Matt 
Sure, make an intelligence check.
-speak Sam 
14?
-speak Matt 
You've heard of something of this description, called a mind flayer.
Strange tentacled creatures which eat your brain right out of your skull.
You don't know much more than that.
-speak Laura 
Mind flayers?
-speak Grog 
How big was this mind flayer, was he like 20 feet tall, Scanlan?
-speak Scanlan 
He was tall, I mean everyone looks 20 feet tall to me, I'm a gnome.
-speak Grog 
Was he bigger than me?
-speak Sam 
Was he bigger than Grog?
-speak Matt 
No, roughly a little shorter than him.
But taller than most.
-speak Scanlan 
He carried himself big.
He was lanky.
-speak Grog 
Let's go fuck him up.
-speak Vex 
No, Grog!
-speak Grog 
What?
-speak Vex 
Do you want to be unconscious again?
We have to be careful here.
-speak Grog 
It was rather restful.
-speak Vex 
How many dwarves did it sound like there were locked in that prison cell?
-speak Scanlan 
Several?
-speak Keyleth 
Did you see Lady Kima?
-speak Scanlan 
No sign of Lady Kima at all.
Just a bunch of dwarves being held against their will, and then one by one being brain sucked by Mr. Lanky Man.
-speak Grog 
And those two big trolls.
-speak Scanlan 
Two big trolls, and ogres, don't forget ogres, there's ogres too.
-speak Grog 
There are ogres?
-speak Scanlan 
Yes, there were two big ogres as well.
And duergar aplenty–maybe four dozen or so, three dozen?
-speak Grog 
You know my tactic.
-speak Taliesin 
Would it be a nature check to see if I learned about this in school?
-speak Matt 
This would be an intelligence check.
-narrate 
Taliesin rolls. 
-speak Taliesin 
I remember nothing.
-speak Grog 
We should use the volcano as part of our strategy.
Like Moses–
-speak Scanlan 
There's a volcano?
-speak Grog 
Well no, the pit–
-speak Scanlan 
Oh the lava, down below?
-speak Grog 
Yeah, there's a shitload of that.
-speak Marisha 
Can I meditate to see if I know anything about this?
17, on intelligence?
-speak Vax 
This seems to match up with the tales that my instructor, Master Tharendril, told me about back in Syngorn.
I wonder if I remember something.
If only I had a small polyhedral to roll– Wow!
-speak Matt 
Keyleth, you've never heard the term mind flayer.
But from your people, you heard stories growing up about something referred to as an illithid.
A nasty entity, from beyond.
As far as you know, all that you've heard, they're considered ghost stories.
Keep kids from wandering dark caves and spaces.
They would take your minds, and you thought this whole time that that was just a fable.
But you do know that they normally aren't solitary; they usually keep company of a colony.
-narrate 
Laura gasps.
-speak Travis 
Fudge.
-speak Liam 
Shit.
-speak Keyleth 
I've never heard them called a mind flayer, but I guess they could be called a mind flayer.
But we call them illithids.
I didn't know they were real, though.
-speak Vex 
What do we do?
-speak Grog 
Why don't we– 
Listen, when my Herd used to wander through the trees and we came upon a force that was greater than our own, we used the landscape to our advantage.
So why don't we provoke an attack?
And then retreat over the bridge.
-speak Scanlan 
And have them all jump over the edge of the cliff?
-speak Grog 
You said they were all gray-eyed, right?
-speak Vex 
At least they'll have to go one at a time, or two at a time across the bridge.
-speak Scanlan 
Well yes, but I think what Grog is talking about is the bulk of the fighting force, getting them to follow us over the bridge and then cutting the bridge.
-speak Grog 
Yeah, like in 300.
Which was a great puppet show I saw.
-speak Vex 
Okay, I like this plan.
-speak Vex 
Maybe we could create a distraction and bring them away from the tunnel's entrance and we can just sneak around them.
-speak Scanlan 
Sneak through the village to the tunnel?
No way! Not all 6 of us.
And a bear.
Are you crazy?
-speak Keyleth 
I have a spell, while I was reading through my book last night, catching up on spells that I kinda forgot about.
I learned something called Hallucinatory Terrain, where I can make the entire terrain look like whatever I want.
-speak Vex 
You can make the chasm look like it's solid ground!
-speak Scanlan 
Can you make the chasm look like it's solid ground?
-speak Grog 
Ooh!
-speak Keyleth 
I can make the chasm look like it's solid ground–
-speak Sam 
Can she do this?
-speak Matt 
She can try.
-speak Sam 
Yes!
-speak Travis 
I like it!
-speak Vex 
Make the big chasm look like solid ground.
They'll fall off the edge!
-speak Percy 
That's a great plan.
-speak Vax 
So if I act as bait to try lure them off the cliff and onto the bridge.
And I'll take the flying carpet and tie it around my back.
-speak Laura 
You better run fast and not get taken!
-speak Liam 
I have boots of haste.
-speak Marisha 
As long as you can haul ass.
-speak Travis 
Saddle up, let's do it.
-speak Marisha 
Before Vax leaves–
-speak Sam 
Wait! Might I interject?
I'm so sorry.
-speak Marisha 
Go ahead.
-speak Sam 
Which side are we gonna chop it on?
Our side or their side?
-speak Travis 
Once he gets back to our side.
-scene set 9
-speak Marisha 
Before Vax leaves, I just put my hands on his shoulders, and I cast Enhance Ability on him, and give you a dexterity boost.
-speak Liam 
Okay.
-speak Sam 
I'm also going to sing a little song to inspire him.
-narrate 
To the tune of "Hey Baby", by No Doubt:
-speak Scanlan 
~Hey baby, hey baby, hey!~
~Dwarves say. Dwarves say.~
~Hey baby, hey baby, hey!~
~On to the bridge and fall down.~
-speak Matt 
All right! So.
-speak Travis 
Was that Gwen Stefani?
-speak Laura 
All right!
-speak Matt 
So, inspiration dice to Vax.
-speak Marisha 
I hope this works.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm gonna set up Bad News on our side of the bridge, and get ready to train it on whatever might try and come across.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Laura 
Are there any big rock formations that I can sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay behind that but also peek around?
-speak Matt 
About 20 feet off from the edge, there is one large stalagmite that you could probably get behind.
-speak Laura 
I'll post up behind that.
-speak Matt 
Keyleth, what are you going to make the terrain look like? 
-speak Marisha 
I want the terrain to look exactly like what it is.
But I just wanna stretch it out a little bit.
So it looks like they've got an extra running space.
-speak Matt 
So you go ahead and cast Hallucinatory Terrain, and you now see an additional 40 feet of the cliff stretching out.
-speak Vex 
It looks very realistic.
-speak Keyleth 
Thank you!
-speak Matt 
And you can actually see that the bridge looks attached to it, it's a very, very convincing illusion.
And you kind of have to remind yourself that it's an illusion, just so you don't fall for it either!
-speak Keyleth 
Yes, be careful guys, please be careful!
-speak Matt 
Vax, you walk across the bridge, keeping your grip on both side rails.
Feeling it rock to and fro from the continuous warm bellowing of wind up from the cavern beneath you.
Eventually you make your way across.
What looks like it should be terrain is actually still the bridge, and it takes you a minute to adjust to that fact.
Eventually you make it to the other side and make purchase on solid stone.
Looking ahead of you, you can see about 60 feet ahead of you the outskirts of the war camp.
-speak Liam 
I stealthily close the distance to the edge of town.
I click my boots of haste together.
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
-speak Matt 
You feel the sudden surge of magical energy through your body like adrenaline just pumping into your system.
-speak Liam 
And I cry out full voice:
-speak Vax 
Listen up, you walking prawn, doom has come for you today.
Step forth, you slimy bastard.
-speak Laura 
Oh fuck.
-speak Vax 
Your trolls can't save you.
I will find you.
No matter how far or how long.
-speak Taliesin 
This is a good plan.
-speak Travis 
Sure it is.
-speak Liam 
It's a great plan.
-speak Marisha 
Are you convincing yourself or are you–
-speak Taliesin 
This is a good plan.
-speak Matt 
About 20 seconds pass.
And then you start hearing it:
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
It sounds like a drum beat.
-speak Vex 
Oh my god.
-speak Scanlan 
Cut the rope, cut the rope!
-speak Vex 
Not yet, not yet, not yet!

Leave Vax there, let's go!

-speak Liam 
I flip the double birds and start walking backwards a little bit.

Just watch your step!
-speak Liam 
Yes, straight back.
-speak Matt 
As you're stepping back, four of the duergar immediately throw javelins directly at you.
-speak Laura 
Oh god!
-speak Matt 
Two of them hit.
The first one strikes you in the torso for 11 damage.
-speak Liam 
Uncanny dodge, so I halve that.
-speak Matt 
The other hits you for a total of eight damage.
-speak Liam 
Got it.
-speak Matt 
14 points of damage from these javelins hitting you.
Like, oh, that's right. They have range!
-speak Liam 
Right, I knew this was coming.
-speak Matt 
One of the trolls runs at you, but its comes at you at an angle, and it clips the cliff edge unknowingly.
It kinda loses its footing for a second, stops and looks around angrily, not sure what happened.
The other one comes from a different angle.
And goes running right off the edge.
-speak Everyone  
Yes!
-speak Sam 
The troll?
-speak Matt 
The ogre comes running forward, right towards you.
There's only solid ground between you and it.
-speak Liam 
Yeah, I'm backing it up, I'm running, man.
-speak Matt 
All right, so you go charging back onto the bridge.
-hide troll

-continue 
As you go running, both trolls and the ogre have just gone off the side.
-narrate 
The table cheers.
-speak Laura 
Badass!
-speak Matt 
You hear them screaming as they tumble into the darkness.
-speak Liam 
I'm laughing as I run.
-speak Matt 
About four duergar also go spilling over the side, screaming as they tumble into the darkness.
-speak Travis 
Yes!
-speak Matt 
The rest of them stop.
-speak Sam 
This was a great plan!
-speak Matt 
As this is happening, you can now see some of duergar at the edge are some of the elite guard, wearing blackened armor.
Two kinda step forward and put their foot out, feeling for purchase, give a nod.
They pull out their swords, and start hacking at the bridge immediately.
-speak Liam 
I'd like to get on the carpet, please.
-speak Sam 
Oh shit.
-speak Laura 
Shit!
-speak Taliesin 
All right, I'm taking a shot.
-speak Laura 
Our ranged attacks, do they reach?
-speak Matt 
From this distance, it's gonna be a serious penalty.
-speak Taliesin 
Not for me! I can shoot basically forever.
-speak Liam 
I'm untying the carpet. Quickly.
-speak Taliesin 
Oh, for the love of god and all that is holy.
Misfire, I gotta–
-speak Laura 
I can at least try, right?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and roll. You're at disadvantage.
-speak Laura 
I fail so hard.
-speak Matt 
As Vex releases her arrow, Percy, you pull the trigger.
There's a slight delay, and you wonder, why isn't it working?
And then you hear this horrible explosion sound, black and red smoke pouring out of the front of the barrel of Bad News.
-speak Taliesin 
All right, so I gotta stop and clean.
-speak Matt 
Bcause you are unable to halt it, both of those duergar take swipes at the bridge.
-speak Taliesin 
Damn it.
-speak Matt 
Both hit with their swords.
-speak Marisha 
Are you on the carpet, Vax?
-speak Travis 
He's getting it out.
-speak Liam 
I don't know, I said I was.
-speak Laura 
Get on it, now.
-speak Matt 
As you're running and pulling the carpet out–
-speak Liam 
Yes!
-speak Matt 
The bridge is cut clean–
-speak Marisha 
Son of a bitch.
-speak Matt 
And begins to fall out from under you.
-speak Liam 
Acrobatics check?
-speak Matt 
This is gonna go ahead and be a dex check now.
-speak Marisha 
You've got advantage!
-speak Matt 
You do.
-speak Laura 
Oh, good.
-speak Liam 
Okay, good, because the first roll was a 1.
The second roll was a 28.
-speak Travis 
Oh my god!
You almost died!
-speak Matt 
All right. You pull out the carpet.
As you feel the bridge beginning give out from under you, you feel this creepy sensation pushing towards the back of your head.
-speak Laura 
Oh no!

-speak Taliesin 
I'm cleaning my gun.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
-speak Travis 
Get your bow ready.
-speak Laura 
I am, I'm ready, it's too far!
-speak Liam 
I survive a free fall and you hit me with that right after?
Oh, not very good.
7.
-speak Laura 
No!
-speak Matt 
As you are running, you get the carpet out, you leap onto it.
And your whole sense and awareness of your surroundings just fades from you.
You just feel your entire body going numb for a second.
And then you feel yourself falling.
-speak Marisha 
Holy shit.
-scene set12
-speak Laura 
Fly down!
Get him!
Get him!
-hide keyleth

-speak Marisha

-speak Matt 
You go and swoop down, fly.
Go ahead and make an athletics check, with disadvantage.
-speak Marisha 
18!
-speak Matt 
You rush down, diving, you grab the back of his armor.
As you yank up on him, you manage to just pull him across and get him to the other edge.
The flying carpet, however, has plummeted down in–
-speak Everyone 
No!
-speak Travis 
Son of a bitch.
-speak Laura 
You lost our flying carpet, you unconscious bastard!
-speak Matt 
However, Keyleth swoops up.
You guys just see them both plummet into darkness and then flying up at the edge of the crevasse on your side.
Your brother, currently just staring off into space and dropping him down with a dull sound.
-speak Vex 
Vax!
-speak Matt 
The bridge slaps onto the side of the cavern.
-speak Laura 
And I run over to Vax.
Can I try to figure out what's wrong with him?
-speak Travis 
The magic carpet is done?
-speak Matt 
It just disappeared into the darkness below.
-speak Laura 
Oh no!
-speak Travis 
I have to erase it...
-speak Marisha 
Bye, carpet.
-speak Taliesin 
No...
-speak Sam 
That was our ticket across the chasm.
-speak Liam 
Yes.
-speak Marisha 
I loved that carpet, damn it.
-speak Matt 
About a minute passes or so, you come back to your senses.
-speak Laura 
Oh, good.
-speak Vax 
What happened?
-speak Taliesin 
I wanna take a shot at the–
-speak Liam 
Noodle-face, yeah.
-speak Matt 
Okay, go for it.
-speak Liam 
Shoot it in the eye, man.
-speak Taliesin 
23 to hit for 20 points of damage.
-speak Matt 
Nice.
You just see this blast of red across the way and the figure is knocked off its feet, about ten feet back.
-speak Laura 
Can you shoot him again?
-speak Taliesin 
Yes.
-speak Marisha 
It's just a carnival game for Percy at this point.
-speak Matt 
You see the duergar start to back away from the cliff side.
-speak Taliesin 
That felt pretty good.
-speak Laura  
How many are left after all that?
-speak Matt 
After all that, you saw a few more filter out from the town, there's about 25 visible at that moment.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to hang on him visually and I'm gonna wait to take another shot until he tries to stand up again.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-scene set13
-speak Laura 
You can shoot him while he's on the ground!
Can't you?
-speak Taliesin 
But it's so much more fun to wait.
-speak Matt 
You can shoot him, but it's at disadvantage to shoot someone who's prone.
-speak Laura 
He's on the ground?
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
-speak Taliesin 
Technically, he's got cover.
And it's funnier to just wait.
-speak Matt 
A moment passes and he kind of drifts back up.
-speak Taliesin 
Taking another shot.
-speak Marisha 
Come on, Percy.
-speak Vax 
Come on, baby.
-speak Taliesin 
He's such an asshole.
-speak Marisha 
Like fish in a barrel.
-speak Liam 
Come on, Von Rolo!
-speak Taliesin

-speak Matt

At that distance, in the dark, it's very hard to get a bead on him.
-hide mindflayer
-continue 
It starts to drift away–
-speak Laura

-hide duergar 
-speak Matt 
The rest of the duergar are now retreating into the city.
-speak Percy 
Man!
-speak Grog 
What're we gonna do? Leave?
-speak Vex 
Maybe we can see if we can find another bridge?
-speak Matt 
You walk over to the edge?
-speak Laura 
Yes.
-speak Matt 
Make a perception check.
-speak Laura 
Nat 20!
-speak Liam 
Hell yeah! Automatic win!
-speak Matt 
You glance over the side.
The bridge is moving slightly in the air currents.
Not all of the bottom floor is lava, there's just streaks of it.
Pouring down from somewhere in this lower chasm.
You see, wrapped up in the ropes of the rope bridge, a tiny little flicker of material.
-speak Vex 
Oh my god!
-speak Grog 
It's the carpet!
-speak Scanlan 
Material?
It's the carpet!
-speak Matt 
It seems to be the carpet.
-speak Marisha 
I'm still an eagle, can I fly down and pick it up?
-speak Matt 
All right.
You glide down, along the cut rope bridge, and there, haphazardly tangled in the ropes is the flying carpet.
As you float down, you also notice some light glinting across the cave floor.
Some kind of rippling and shifting.
-narrate 
Laura gasps.
-speak Laura 
It's water down there?
-speak Marisha 
I retrieve the magic carpet.
-speak Matt 
You grab the magic carpet, make your way back up to the surface.
-hide gianteagle
-show keyleth -4
-speak Keyleth

There's some water down on the cavern floor, too.
Might be worth exploring.
-speak Scanlan 
Exploring?
Shoudn't we just try get straight across?
-speak Keyleth 
They're prepared for us now. If we could find a different route past...
-speak Vex 
Kima went deeper down.
-speak Keyleth 
That's true.
-speak Vex 
So probably it'd be best to go down.
-speak Keyleth 
I don't wanna fight that guy.
-speak Vax 
He's also gone and told all of his friends about our attack.
If we can, it'd be good to put this guy in the ground.

-speak Marisha 
Me and Percy are on the carpet, we're going to go look.
-speak Matt 
All right, so the two of you get on the carpet, and begin to make your way down into this giant crevasse.
As you get down, the air gets warmer and warmer.
You see this is a much larger space than the upper half. It funnels up into where the bridge was.
-speak Marisha 
Do I see any tunnels, or areas that look like it leads someplace of interest?
-speak Matt 
You see a large pool of water that feeds a couple of rivers.
There are sections of the wall where there are couple of openings into some sort of magma reserve, with three streams pouring out.
One of them is pooling and cooling as it hits the water, this glowing mass of slow-growing rock.
One flows back in the direction you guys came from, but underneath.
There's a big lava pool, which is giving a little bit of light.
You see the inside of a tunnel, that goes at a decline, back in the direction you came.
-speak Sam 
Lava tunnels?
What, are you crazy?
-speak Marisha 
I keep going.
-speak Matt 
On the opposite side, there's a small outcropping and another, smaller, waterfall.
-speak Liam 
On Cthulhu's side, you're talking about?
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
-speak Marisha 
I cast Control Water, and I take the water at the bottom of the cave, and I bend it, and I want to try use it to solidify the lava flows.
-scene set15
-speak Matt 
You also notice two trolls and an ogre currently trying to stay afloat.
As suddenly, one of them gets pulled under the water, down to the bottom.
-narrate 
Sam yells in alarm.
-continue 
You begin moving the water to the sides and you begin to cool some of the lava flows.
You can see the glowing red magma begin to cool to a dark black and become solid.
-speak Marisha 
There's a lava flow going down a larger tunnel, right?
Okay, I take all of the water, and I really just concentrate, and I gather just a big column, and I push it down that tunnel.
-speak Matt 
You force the water into a geyser in that direction.
As it sprays across the front, you can see it begins to cool some of the magma.
It's a pretty hefty flow.
You do cool parts of it, but it's gonna be difficult to try and actually get it to stop.
You notice the lava flow doesn't coat the entire floor of the tunnel.
There's some portion of it that is walkable, adjacent to the lava.
-speak Percy 
I'm not sure the lava cave is a good idea.
-speak Keyleth 
I'm sorry, that lava cave just looks important.
-speak Percy 
I know. Because of the lava.
-speak Keyleth 
Yeah.
-speak Percy  
Let's go tell the others what we've found, and then we'll come back and decide which way to go.
-speak Keyleth 
Okay, okay.
-speak Percy 
Sometimes a lava cave is just a lava cave.

Yeah, let's not go down there where there's things eating trolls!
-speak Vex 
We're gonna have to go down eventually, so.
-speak Scanlan 
Why do we have to go down there, there's nothing that we need down there!
-speak Keyleth  
But across the way is a 25-man battle with an mind flayer.
-speak Scanlan 
There's 6 of us and one of us is Grog!
-speak Vex 
Well, everybody keeps saying that everything is deeper and deeper, so I think we're gonna have to go deep down.
Eventually.
-speak Keyleth 
I agree with Vex on this one.
-speak Liam 
Can't we just fly straight over head?
-speak Keyleth  
Not with the eye of that mind flayer.
-speak Vex 
Yeah. It can grab us.
-speak Vax 
Can't we go 150 feet in the air, and–
-speak Keyleth 
I think you were at least 150 feet across that bridge when he did that to you.
-speak Matt 
You were about, loosely, 80 feet across when it got you.
-speak Liam 
So its range is probably like 100 feet.
And you said it's 150-ish feet in here, though, to the ceiling?
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
-speak Percy 
They have ranged weapons as well.
-speak Vex 
I think we should go down!
-speak Scanlan 
But what's down there?
-speak Vex 
Kima!
-speak Scanlan 
But there's no sign of anything intelligent down there, other than something that's eating trolls underwater.
It could be just giant whales down there!
We have no idea! There's no sign of humans at all!
It's lava and death animals!
-speak Vex 
If I go down there, can I look in one of the tunnels and see if I find tracks?
-speak Scanlan 
How're you gonna go in the tunnels?
-speak Vex 
I've got a flying carpet!
-speak Scanlan 
There's lava!
-speak Vex 
There's tunnels that don't have lava flowing into them.
-speak Scanlan 
If you burn the carpet-
-speak Keyleth 
And I can control water for at least an hour.
I'll go with Vex. I can cool lava as we go.
-speak Vex 
Please, Scanlan, let me look for tracks. Please?
-speak Scanlan 
Tracks in a river?
-speak Vex 
Tracks in a tunnel.
-speak Scanlan 
It's not that kind of a tunnel!
-speak Matt 
On this side of the cavern, there is a descending, large tunnel.
With a river of lava that covers half of that path.
Towards the other side, there is a waterfall pouring out of the side of the wall.
-speak Scanlan 
Can't go in there.
-speak Keyleth 
We can go in there!
-speak Scanlan 
There's water pouring out of it!
-speak Keyleth 
I can make that stop happening.
-speak Scanlan 
But what would we find in a tunnel with water pouring out of it?
It's not like anything lives up there!
-speak Keyleth 
I would much rather face random beasts than mind flayers who can suck my brain out.
-speak Percy 
There would be no random beasts, though. It's nothing but plumbing.
-speak Vax 
Kima did not fall prey to random beasts, she fell prey to these shits.
-speak Vex 
All right, fine!
Let's do whatever you guys want to do.
-scene set16
-speak Keyleth 
I don't think we can fight this guy and win!
Why can't Vex and I go check it out before we do this?
-speak Vex 
I think we should go.
-speak Keyleth 
Let's do it! Fuck it!
-speak Vex 
We're going!
-speak Keyleth 
They don't control us!
-speak Matt 
All right, you hop on the flying carpet?
-speak Laura and Marisha 
Yes!
-speak Liam 
The fellowship has broken.
-speak Sam 
Wait, you're stealing our flying carpet?
-speak Matt 
Keyleth and Vex have leaped on the flying carpet–
-speak Keyleth 
We're just checking it out! We're coming back!
-speak Vex 
We're coming back!
-speak Keyleth 
Just wait ten god damn minutes.
-speak Matt 
They shout, as they disappear into the darkness below the cavern.
-speak Vax 
The mind flayer isn't on pause!
-hide grog
-hide percy
-hide scanlan
-speak Laura 
I pull out a lantern as we fly.
-speak Matt 
Are two of you are going down towards the water?
-speak Marisha 
Yes.
-speak Vex 
Part the water!
-speak Matt 
The rest of you kind of stand at the edge of the crevasse going, 'Uh…'
-speak Marisha 
I take the flow, where the water is coming out of this waterfall, and I reverse it.
-speak Matt 
The ogre is not anywhere to be seen.
There's just a slight ripple in the water's surface.
-speak Laura 
We don't wanna land, we just wanna go towards the tunnel.
-speak Matt 
Right.
Keyleth, you're able to completely stop the flow of the waterfall, but you can't quite manage to make it flow backwards.
Just stopping the flow, holding it in mid-air.
However, as the water vanishes, you can see a tunnel entrance in the cliffwall behind where the waterfall had been.
Carving into the cliff-face.
-speak Laura 
Fuck all y'all bitches!
-speak Taliesin 
Whoa.
-speak Laura 
Let's go in there!
-speak Sam 
Meanwhile, back up top, I'm saying:
-speak Scanlan 
They're not gonna find anything. They're not gonna find any tunnels.
-scene panther
-speak Laura 
Let's stealth? Let's be very quiet.
Can you turn into an animal?
-speak Marisha 
Oh, I can!
-hide keyleth
-show panther -4
-continue
I go into a black panther form.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Vax 
Scanlan, remember when we had women in this party?
-speak Matt 
Okay, both of you guys roll stealth.
-speak Marisha 
I have advantage from being a panther.
19.
-speak Laura 
15.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and roll for survival if you want to check for tracks.
-speak Laura 
16?
-speak Matt 
You do see some scratches into the mud of the surface there that lead into a tunnel.
You see drag marks, you see some footprints.
But the footprints appear to be dwarven, or dwarf-sized in nature.
-speak Marisha 
Can I do a nature check to see what the scratch marks look like?
If they look like any type of beast I might recognize.
-speak Matt 
It looks like fingers being pulled through.
-speak Laura 
Can we see where the tunnel leads?
-speak Matt 
The tunnel goes back about 25 feet and then stops.
It's just a little alcove.
You see within the tunnel a series of skeletons or bodies that are partially decomposed.
And you see what looks like a pile of rags in the corner.
-speak Laura 
Oh, I'm so scared.
Here's the thing, I remember another situation very similar to this.
And it was the lair of one of those umber hulks.
-speak Matt 
The actual tunnel is about 6 feet across and it would not be able to fit an umber hulk.
-speak Laura 
Oh, really?
Can I go along the walls very stealthily and see if I can find any opening, anything else?
-speak Matt 
As you step inside and put your hands across the walls–
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
-speak Matt 
The walls are solid, this appears to have been carved out over time.
And as you move in, you see the pile of rags is less a pile of rags and a humanoid, curled up tight.
Unconscious, asleep, or dead. Not moving.
-speak Marisha 
What do they look like?
-speak Matt  
You can't tell from here.
It's just like kind of curled over in the corner.
-speak Vex 
Keyleth, I think you should turn into an eagle.
What if you turn into something big enough that it can carry me, I hop on your back and we throw something at it?
And then fly away.
-speak Matt  
While you guys are having this conversation, because you're talking to each other-
-speak Laura 
Fuck. We were talking really quietly!
-scene clarota 
-speak Matt   
The thing in the corner kind of rouses and shoots up out of sudden fear.
You guys are seeing this for the first time, but it's familiar.
-show clarota 4
-continue
Dressed in rags.
Smooth head, purplish and blue in color, a series of tentacles in its mouth.
A giant scar drawn across one of its eyes, and it looks filthy, and it looks desperate.
And just looks at the two of you and you hear a sudden voice in your minds.
-speak Laura 
Oh fuck!
-speak Matt  
No movement, just conversation, saying:
-speak Mind Flayer  
What, who are you?
-narrate
Matt's voice for the mind flayer is slow and raspy. He uses his hand to mimic the movement of the tentacles.
-narrate
The performance as a whole is very alien.
-hide panther
-show keyleth -4
-speak Marisha 
I drop wildshape.
I drop to my knees and I look at him and just say:
-speak Keyleth 
It's okay, we're friends.
-speak Matt  
He puts up a hand, and you see there's a flicker of arcane energy.
A barrier appears between you and this creature.
And just looks.
-speak Marisha 
I take my Druidcraft and I just make a little flower.
-speak Vex 
Oh my God.
-speak Marisha 
And there's a pretty little tulip and I lay it at the edge of the barrier.
-speak Matt  
Make a persuasion check. With disadvantage.
-speak Marisha 
9. I'm not a very charismatic person.
-speak Matt  
It holds its place, and the voice again hits your mind and says:
-speak Mind Flayer  
How did you find me?
What is your purpose here?
-speak Vex 
We don't mean to disturb you, great sire.
-speak Mind Flayer  
You will die if you try anything.
-speak Vex 
We're not going to!
-speak Mind Flayer  
I will not fall here, I will not die here.
-speak Vex 
We mean to help you!
We mean to find our way out, and find our friend.
That's all.
-speak Keyleth 
We don't want to die either.
-speak Vex 
Please.
Who did this to you?
We can help you.
-speak Keyleth 
Let's not die together.
-speak Matt  
You can see as you get a better look at it, it definitely has a large scar across part of its face.
And it looks to be wearing remnants of a robe similar to what Scanlan was describing.
However, it is tattered, it's dirtied, sullied by the elements and god knows what other liquids.
It also has this strange kind of metallic skull cap that's currently placed around its head.
-speak Mind Flayer  
Leave me in peace, then, or give me a reason not to slay you where you stand.
-speak Vex 
We can help you get revenge against your brethren who did this to you.
-speak Matt  
There's a slight change in mood, you just feel.
-speak Mind Flayer   
Revenge?
-speak Vex 
Yes.
-speak Matt  
Make a persuasion check.
-speak Laura 
19?
-speak Matt  
The barrier flickers and dissipates.
It reaches over and grabs what looks like a gnarled stick.
Pulls itself up onto its legs.
What looked like a small creature is now standing extremely tall.
Scraping the top of this maybe 8-foot-tall ceiling in this tunnel.
-speak Keyleth 
Hi.
-speak Matt  
It takes a step forward and says, 
-speak Mind Flayer  
Revenge? You speak of revenge.
This is a language I wish to know very well.
-speak Keyleth 
You found the right motley crew.
-speak Vex 
Should we bring it with us?
-speak Keyleth 
Would you like to come with us?
-speak Vex 
To leave this cavern?
-speak Keyleth 
Meet our friends? We have friends.
-speak Matt  
It kind of gives you both a look.
There's a slight lurching to it as it gives this horrible guttural chuckle. 
-speak Mind Flayer  
Friends?
That's a word I haven't heard in a long time.
Not one I take to heart, but allies, in time, that I can understand.
Take me to your allies.
-speak Keyleth 
What's your name?
-speak Clarota  
My name… Clarota.
-speak Keyleth 
Can we call you Clarence for short?
-speak Clarota  
No!
-speak Keyleth 
Okay! Clar-ota.
-speak Vex 
Please, join us on the carpet.
-speak Matt  
He carefully steps on the carpet, his tentacles making wet, slithering noises.
-speak Laura 
I keep a distance.
-speak Matt  
Moving around, its mouth and its eyes are constantly darting.
It looks extremely nervous, a cornered animal that's just barely being coaxed onto this journey.
You see with each step it takes, there a slight flicker of arcane energy at the tip of its fingers.
Like it's just prepared for anything to go terribly wrong.
It steps onto the carpet and goes, 
-speak Clarota   
Take me to your allies.
-speak Keyleth 
You can even maybe call them friends, even?
-speak Vex 
Not just yet!
-speak Matt  
It crosses its legs and sits on the carpet, holding its staff to its chest on the far corner staring at all of you and says, 
-speak Clarota  
Go. Now.
-speak Vex 
Hold on tight.
-speak Matt  
You guys make your way up to the top.
The rest of you, eventually you see the carpet rise over the edge of the crevasse.
Comes down to a rest, as your party has now brought with you the stuff of nightmares.

-speak Vex 
Hold on! Hold on!
-speak Grog 
What is that? Oh my god!
-speak Matt  
It leaps off the carpet, hovering in mid-air, and you can see this crackle of fire in its hand as it starts to panic.
-speak Vex 
No! No!
Peace, friends!
We are ourselves! We are not controlled.
He's an ally.
-speak Scanlan 
He's a friend?
-speak Keyleth 
He prefers–
-speak Clarota  
Ally.
-speak Vex 
Ally.
-speak Scanlan 
Ally.
-speak Keyleth 
Ally.
-speak Percy 
Ally?
-speak Grog 
What's on your head?
-speak Matt  
He gives you this keen look of, huh.
The last person I expected to ask a question.
It kind of hobbles forward with its gnarled staff.
-speak Clarota  
I was cast out from my hive.
I am cursed with the mark of the arcane.
My people see that as an ill omen. I was discarded, left to die.
-speak Vex 
Let's destroy your hive.
-speak Clarota  
No.
-speak Vex 
No?
-speak Clarota  
You see, the hive is sick.
The mind that keeps us safe is no longer its own.
One, an alien one, has come and taken the mind hostage.
It has taken my people as its own playthings.
I was able to escape its mental grasp.
-speak Laura 
Oh! Tinfoil hat!
-speak Marisha 
Magneto helmet!
This is the guy we've needed this whole time!
-speak Clarota  
My people will not so easily escape its grasp, they are now the control of this creature.
-speak Scanlan 
If we find this creature, we might be able to free your hive as well.
-speak Clarota  
That would be why I wish to have your alliance.
Help me free our hivemind, free my people.
-speak Travis 
Can I make an insight check?
-speak Laura 
Yeah, could I also make one?
-speak Matt  
I would put this in a group insight check right now.
Everyone roll!

-speak Sam

-speak Matt  
As alien and unfamiliar as its mannerisms and speech and interests may be, you get the feeling that it's speaking out of desperation.
And it's speaking out of genuine interest.
You've piqued it with the hint of revenge, you've piqued it with the idea of alliance as opposed to being alone.
You get the feeling that it speaks the truth.
It genuinely is asking for your help in freeing its people from whatever is influencing their current actions.
-speak Vex 
Clarota… 
-speak Scanlan 
What's his name?
Can we just call him Clarence?
-speak Percy 
Clara. It could be a she.
-speak Vex 
We are very interested in being allies with you.
Might we have your word that upon defeating this creature, we will be safe?
-speak Scanlan 
And as a symbol of our dedication to you, I'd love to play you just a little bit of a song that might heal some of those wounds and scrapes that you seem to have all over your body.
-speak Matt  
He gives you the dirtiest look you've ever received.
-speak Scanlan 
It's a pretty good song!
-speak Matt  
Make a persuasion check.
-speak Sam 
17.
-speak Matt  
He takes a sudden step forward towards you, wet noises from his tentacles.
-speak Laura 
Ew, ugh!
-speak Clarota  
Play this song.
-speak Vex 
It better be good!
-narrate 
To the tune of "Sexual Healing", by Marvin Gaye.
-speak Scanlan 
~When I get that feeling, I want Clarota healing.~
~Clarota healing is something that's good for you.~
~Ooh ooh ooh.~
-speak Laura 
Clarota's dancing, I can see it!
-speak Matt  
Make a performance check.
-speak Sam 
A performance check! 18!
-speak Matt  
It stands still, glaring at you.
But out of the corner of your eye you swear you see its toe tapping.
Then, its tentacles withdraw in such a way that puts you off and the song comes to a halt.
-speak Clarota   
I'd not heard a song.
I shall call upon you for more in the future.
-speak Vex 
Oh!
-speak Scanlan 
There's many more where that came from!
-speak Clarota  
Now we talk about how we can kill K'varn.
-speak Vex 
K'varn!
-speak Matt  
And that's where we're going to go ahead and end it for today, guys.
-speak Sam 
End scene!
-speak Matt  
That went very interestingly!
We'll pick up from that point.
-speak Marisha 
Sorry we had to rebel, you guys.
-speak Laura 
Yeah sorry about that, you guys.
-speak Marisha 
It was for a good cause!
-speak Liam 
Thank you for rebelling, and staking out on your own!
-speak Matt  
You've acquired for the moment a very curious ally.
Yeah, this will be an interesting branching point for next week.
-speak Laura 
Oh my gosh.
-speak Travis 
We should get some damn hats.
-speak Laura 
I know!
We should get him to make us hats!
-speak Marisha 
We definitely need one for Grog.
We have to get him to make us hats for Grog.
-speak Travis 
Why me?
-speak Matt  
Well, anyway, goodnight!
