-speak Matt 
(laughs) Go ahead and roll damage on this.
-speak Laura 
Oh, sick.
-speak Travis 
With a 12?
-speak Matt 
For flavor, roll a 12.
Why not?
You're pulling his jaw.
-speak Travis 
Excellent!
(laughing)
-speak Ashley 
He rolled really high.
-speak Travis 
15.
-speak Matt 
After you throw him onto the hook, his axe clatters to the ground and he reaches up with his hands to grab you and it looks like he's pulling back to try and bring you in for a headbutt.
This angry look of burning rage in his white eyes, this fucked-up duergar with all these scars on his face, as he reaches up towards you, you take your giant hand and jam it into his maw.
With this horrible (choking SFX) sound, as you put all your muscle into it, glaring him in the face with a terrible grin you (breaking SFX) and yank the jaw off from the bottom of his head.
-speak All 
(cheering)
-speak Matt 
A spatter of blood across the front of his mouth and his tongue dangling, he gives out this horrible (gagging scream) this gurgling scream as all the blood begins to pour up into his throat.
With that, clutching the jaw with one hand, you begin to pummel him in the face over and over, with his jaw, as he's watching, his head slowly cave in.
-speak Travis 
(laughing) Yes!
-speak Sam 
I think he's going to make it.
-speak Matt 
Until eventually, he's no longer moving and you throw the jaw to the ground, just coated with blood.
-speak Liam 
You're going to pull through, buddy.
-speak Laura 
Pike!
I think Grog, um, I think he did his job.
-speak Ashley 
I scream out, 
-speak Ashley 
Good job Grog!
That's your best one yet!
-speak Marisha 
And they say video games are violent.
(all laugh)

-speak Laura 
(gagging sounds)
-speak Matt 
As you've entered the room now–
-speak Ashley 
Wait, is he dead?
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
Oh, he's very dead.
-speak Travis 
We made cheese of him.
-speak Matt 
He lies there limply on the wall, twitching every few seconds.
Grog, still in a rage, you look over at the other individual.
You can see now strapped to this wooden frame is a smallish humanoid, female, currently chained and being pulled on a rack.
You can see bunch of scars and wounds, blood pouring from each one of them.
-speak Sam 
Is that our girl?
-speak Laura 
That's our girl!
-speak Taliesin 
I'm running in.
Do I know how to disable the rack?
-speak Matt 
You can probably figure it out with a tinker.
-speak Liam 
Pike!
-speak Travis 
Is it chains or rope?
-speak Laura 
Come heal her!
-speak Liam 
We need Pike in here!
-speak Travis 
Is it chains or rope?
-speak Sam 
I'll go!
-speak Matt 
It's chains holding her on.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to undo it.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Sam 
Wait.
Do we know it's her?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a tinker check.
-speak Laura 
It's her.
It's gotta be her.
-speak Orion 
Whoever it is, we should help.
-speak Taliesin 
What do I add?
Is it proficiency bonus?
-speak Matt 
Proficiency bonus.
-speak Taliesin 
12.
-speak Matt 
12?
You take a moment and you manage to find where the winch to this machine is, where you can go ahead and release the tension and eventually the chains go a little more slack and (gasps) the halfling woman takes a deep breath and looks about the room a second, looks like there's a bit of a haze, but through the haze there's this constant anger and she looks down and goes: 
-speak Matt 
So?
Are you gonna let me go?
Come on!
Release these chains!
-speak Ashley 
Who is she?
-speak Travis 
Wait, wait.
Find out who she is first.
-speak Laura 
Can we insight and make sure that it's really who she–
-speak Matt 
You can indeed.
This is an insight check.
-speak Laura 
Great, I don't get any… Anybody else want to roll for insight?
-speak Liam 
Five, one.
Pike, roll well.
The twins fucked it.
-speak Ashley 
Insight?
-speak Liam 
Scanlan!
Come up here!
-speak Sam 
Yeah, yeah, oh.
-speak Ashley 
15!
15?
-speak Liam 
She's not in her right mind.
-speak Matt 
It's a very small room, only a few people can make it in here.
-speak Sam 
I'm gonna take a peek at her.
What do I do?
What do I roll?
-speak Liam 
Insight to see if she's in her right mind.
-speak Ashley 
15?
18 is better.
-speak Matt 
At this point, it's pretty apparent that whatever this woman is, she's been here a while and has been subjected to many, many horrible things and still has that spark of life to her, mainly out of vengeance, anger, and pain, but she does not seem to be overtly aggressive or trying to deceive you; just trying to get out of these fucking chains.
-speak Laura 
Well, let's let her go.
-speak Orion 
I'll do an Arcana check on her.
-speak Matt 
What's that?
Arcana check?
To…?
-speak Orion 
See if there's like any kind of magical impurities in her.
-speak Travis 
If she's under the Imperius Curse.
-speak Matt 
Best you can tell, there's none.
-speak Liam 
I'm pulling out my lockpicks and I'm going to start working on–
-speak Sam 
I'm going to heal her with a little bit of a song.
-speak Liam 
And you know my lockpick snaps so… just totally broken.
-speak Ashley 
How hurt is she?
-speak Sam 
If I may.
-speak Matt 
She's pretty rough.
As you look up, she's not clothed.
Her body is just a spray of scars and gashes and rake marks.
She's been tortured to an extent you hadn't seen in person, and to still be tensing her muscles against the chains and looking at you with this intensity, if this is indeed Lady Kima, you now see why she's made the reputation she has.
-speak Liam 
Grog, the locking mechanism on this is jammed.
-speak Sam 
Okay.
So, I step forward and I pull out my flute and I sing, (singing) 
-speak Sam 
As long as I got my song and flute, I'm gonna give some healing to you.
Love and magic in the air tonight, gonna give you some hit points.
Gonna give you some hit points, gonna give you some hit points of our love.
(all laugh)

-speak Sam 
Dadadanana, okay.
I roll nine hit points.
-speak Matt 
The fresher wounds seal up, the blood flow comes to a stop.
You see her muscles tense for a moment - her tension in her muscles relax for a minute.
She looks to you for a second and says, 
-speak Matt 
It's been a while since I've heard a song.
Thank you.
-speak Sam 
It was a slow jam.
-speak Taliesin 
Please be careful for a moment.
Can someone cover her ears for just a second?
-speak Travis 
Yeah, I got it.
-speak Ashley 
Earmuffs.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to utility shot - I'm going to put my gun against the lock, somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and roll damage.
You don't have to roll to hit, it's right there.
-speak Taliesin 
15.
Is it two locks?
-speak Matt 
Well, there's one chain for the legs, one chain for the arms.
-speak Taliesin 
Okay.
15 for the leg.
10 for the arm.
-speak Matt 
(gunshot sound) The legs get free.
(gunshot sound) The chain mostly snaps on the top part, but not quite enough.
It's enough for you, Grog, to-
-speak Travis 
I got it!
(snarling)
-speak Matt 
You reach over and bring it down, with a brief moment of extreme tension as the whole room watches Grog walk up with his axe and swing it down towards this halfling.
Before you have a moment to stop, everyone's heart skips a beat.
The chain is bisected–
-speak Liam 
Ease down!
Ease down.
-speak Matt 
–at which point the halfling woman immediately jumps to her feet with almost like a kip-up stand and is now standing on top of the table.
Her arms are still bound and she - (groans) You can now see where the metal was weakened from the axe blow.
She (metal snapping SFX) pulls herself free from the metal binding–
-speak Travis 
That's hot.
-speak Matt 
–there's a blister across her wrist, from how long she's been pulling against these restraints.
But she bore through it, with a little bit of blood that trickles from that wound.
She has freed herself and she looks around the rest of the group.
-speak Matt 
So, I take it you're not from around here?
-speak Orion 
No!
Would you like some water?
-speak Matt 
She grabs it from you, pulls off the cork and just starts chugging like she hasn't had anything to drink in a long time.
-speak Laura 
Lady Kima, we need to get you out of here.
-speak Liam 
Allura has sent us.
-speak Matt 
She caps it off after a moment and takes a deep breath.
-speak Matt 
I'd hoped she would.
It was foolish of me to come down here so unprepared.
Just knew there wasn't much time.
-speak Matt 
(chuckles)
-speak Liam 
Time 'til what?
-speak Matt 
She looks around and says, 
-speak Matt 
Look, we don't- it's a story.
I have no–
-speak Matt 
And she kind of points to her pretty much unclothed, unarmored form, and says, 
-speak Matt 
I need to find my implements.
We need to get out of here.
-speak Travis 
Could I offer to you this black, studded leather, dwarven armor?
It's not leather, actually.
-speak Liam 
It's magical, it'll fit you.
-speak Orion 
Would you care for this robe?
-speak Laura 
Which sounds better?
-speak Matt 
What armor were you offering her?
-speak Travis 
It's the black, dwarven armor–
-speak Liam 
The armor that I found and gave to Grog.
It's magical.
-speak Matt 
Oh, the studded leather.
-speak Liam 
Yes.
-speak Travis 
It's in the bag.
-speak Matt 
She goes, 
-speak Matt 
Sure, it works for now.
-speak Matt 
She takes it from you and starts putting it on.
You see her wincing as she puts it on, as it covers some of the wounds.
Her whole body is just sore, but she still pushes through it.
-speak Ashley 
I'm going to heal her a little bit more.
-speak Matt 
Okay.
-speak Ashley 
I'll put my hands on her.
I'm sorry.
You're not fully healed, let me help you out.
-speak Travis 
(quietly) Grog likes scars.
-speak Matt 
As you do, she takes a moment and she says - You heal her and she goes, 
-speak Matt 
Can I-
-speak Matt 
She sees your mace and goes, 
-speak Matt 
Can I borrow that for a second?
-speak Ashley 
Uh…
-speak Matt 
Please?
-speak Ashley 
My mace?
-speak Matt 
Your mace, please.
-speak Ashley 
What do you need it for?
(all laugh)

-speak Travis 
You can have mine.
-speak Matt 
Do you trust me?
-speak Ashley 
I don't know.
This is all I have to protect myself.
-speak Matt 
You've come this far.
-speak Orion 
Grog has something for you.
-speak Sam 
Say yes to life, Pike.
-speak Ashley 
All right, well, I also have a morningstar, but this is–
(all laugh)

-speak Ashley 
Are you gonna give it back?
-speak Matt 
As you hand it out, she grabs it from your hands–
-speak Ashley 
That was rude.
-speak Matt 
–walks to the edge of the table–
-speak Ashley 
I don't like her.
-speak Matt 
–stares at the dwarf that is currently hooked onto the wall.
(angry yell) And with a yell, slams it right into his face, causing his head to explode against the back of the wall.
Slams it again and again and again, and is just making hamburger of his entire body.
The arm sloughs off and she's just going nuts.
You can see her bludgeoning over and over again with a spray of gore on her.
And there's this look of anger, frustration–
-speak Laura 
She's raging.
-speak Matt 
–and a sick sense of joy a little bit in her eyes in how she's just tearing this dwarf apart.
Eventually, after this frenzy, you're all taken aback, and she takes a moment.
(heavy breathing) There is very little left recognizable of what once was a duergar.
-speak Sam 
I notice a bulge in Grog's pants.
(all laugh)

-speak Orion 
I use my Mage Hand to slowly pick up my bottle of water…
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
Okay.
She takes the mace she borrowed from you.
(splatter sound)
-speak Ashley 
I'm sorry I questioned you.
-speak Matt 
As she begins to hand it back to you, there's a slight flash of radiant energy that emanates from her hand, and it burns all of the blood that currently encapsulates the mace off, and hands it back to you.
-speak Matt 
Thank you.
I needed that.
-speak Ashley 
You're very welcome.
I'm sorry I questioned you.
-speak Orion 
Give her something, Grog!
Let her use one of your things!
-speak Travis 
That was amazing.
(all laugh)

-speak Orion 
Like, you know, give her one of your things, Grog.
-speak Travis 
Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe?
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
If you want to part with it, certainly.
-speak Travis 
Oh, uh.
(clears throat, sniffs) Maybe we should get out of here.
(all laugh)

-speak Taliesin 
Why don't we collect your things?
-speak Laura 
Yeah, where are they?
Do you know?
-speak Taliesin 
I would assume they're being stored upstairs.
-speak Matt 
I have no idea.
They're either in the vault or they're in the armory.
-speak Sam 
Vault or the armory?
Those are places that we can go?
-speak Laura 
There's a vault?
-speak Taliesin 
Are there stairs in the room that we're in?
-speak Matt 
As far as I can tell, my–
-speak Liam 
Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary?
We have a secret entrance to this place.
We could leave now.
Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost?
-speak Matt 
She thinks to herself for a second, and goes, 
-speak Matt 
They are divine implements, gifted to me from an avatar of Bahamut directly.
I feel, to leave them behind would be a partial failure to my quest.
Not to mention, that what we may face beyond this, we'll need every bit of help we can get.
-speak Travis 
Oh, shit.
-speak Liam 
Well, that's that then.
-speak Orion 
You'll have a friend in us, that's for sure.
-speak Laura 
Let's find the frigging vault!
-speak Taliesin 
Let's go upstairs.
-speak Liam 
Let's go to the vault!
Let's go upstairs.
-speak Matt 
As you show the back of that card, she gives you a look and smiles and says, 
-speak Matt 
Ah.
It's good to see that your scale of color does not belie your intent.
That is a face I've not seen for some time.
I thank you.
-speak Matt 
She leaps off the table.
-speak Matt 
So.
-speak Matt 
(sighs) 
-speak Matt 
Shall we?
-speak Sam 
Do you know where the vault is?
-speak Matt 
I can show you.
-speak Laura 
(whispering) Yes!
-speak Sam 
Lead the way!
-speak Marisha 
I go up to her, still in my Minxy form, and I rub on her legs.
-speak Taliesin 
Have you dropped the body yet?
-speak Travis 
I get right up behind them too, competing for space.
-speak Taliesin 
Are you dragging a dead body around?
-speak Marisha 
No, I dropped the body.
While she was talking, I took the body, and I drug it back, and I buried my shame.
(all laugh)

-speak Marisha 
So, first, I buried my shame.
-speak Matt 
Your shame has been sufficiently buried.
(laughter continues)

-speak Orion 
Hashtag bury your shame.
-speak Marisha 
And I purr.
-speak Matt 
She doesn't look at you, but she pats you absentmindedly as she passes you, her direct intent on heading back up those stairs herself.
-speak Laura 
All right.
-speak Sam 
Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?
-speak Laura 
Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out, and maybe give them some food to try to help them out, if we can.
-speak Travis 
In the meantime, I have a greatsword or a morningstar mace that you can have until we find your items.
-speak Matt 
Greatsword.
-speak Travis 
Greatsword it is.
-speak Matt 
She takes it from you, and the sword is a little over a foot taller than she is.
Maybe a little more than that.
-speak Laura 
She's really fricking buff.
-speak Matt 
But as you hand it to her, she still takes it, and you can see–
-speak Liam 
She's a ripped halfling.
-speak Laura 
That's pretty badass.
-speak Matt 
–she is a built halfling female.
She has seen some war, and she has survived some shit.
-speak Liam 
She's the Tyler Durden of halflings.
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
Kind of, yeah.
-speak Travis 
As I see her grab the sword, I ask, 
-speak Travis 
Would you care for some ale?
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
She glances over her shoulder at you, and says, 
-speak Matt 
Later.
We have nothing to celebrate for yet.
-speak Travis 
Absolutely.
Plenty of time!
(all laugh)

-speak Liam 
I think Grog is smitten!
-speak Laura 
She comes to your knee.
-speak Liam 
Oh my goodness!
-speak Laura 
Can I run in the little prison, and tell the dwarves, if they are conscious, to say, 
-speak Laura 
Don't exit from where you came.
There's a secret entrance up and in a store room.
Go that way, and stealth out.
-speak Matt 
One of the ones that was semi-conscious–
-speak Laura 
All of that, I say all of it.
-speak Matt 
He sits up and looks at– (laughs) That's fucked up.
Sits up and looks back at you and - (ragged breathing) 
-speak Matt 
Thank ye.
Thank ye kindly.
-speak Laura 
Here's some cheese!
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
He takes it hungrily through the bars and just starts eating it, incessantly, as you leave.
-speak Taliesin 
Government cheese.
-speak Liam 
Is provolone all you've got?
-speak Matt 
Lady Kima's already up the stairs.
-speak Laura 
It's Velveeta.
-speak Matt 
(disgusted groan) Velveeta!
-speak Sam 
We're following up the stairs.
-speak Marisha 
(laughs) It's calories!
-speak Matt 
All right.
Clean this off here.
-speak Laura 
Oh goodness, oh goodness!
-speak Taliesin 
It's going to be fun!
Savage burning–
-speak Travis 
I'm right with Minxy, competing for first place.
-speak Liam 
I place a hand on Lady Kima's shoulder–
-speak Marisha 
First place, for how fucked-up we are.
-speak Travis 
Perfection!
(laughs)
-speak Marisha 
Perfection!
(laughs)
-speak Liam 
–place a hand on Kima's shoulder and say, 
-speak Liam 
Please, allow me,
-speak Liam 
and move several feet ahead of her and start sneaking along.
-speak Matt 
As you move up to her, you notice she's standing at the bottom of the stairs with a tension, staring up at the top of the stairway, where Clarota is looking down at her–
-speak Laura 
(gasps)
-speak Matt 
–and backing away, and she goes–
-speak Orion 
Oh!
Yes.
Uh–
-speak Laura 
Wait- Wait!
-speak Matt 
Who is this filthy–
-speak Taliesin 
No no no no!
-speak Marisha 
(screams)
-speak Orion 
I put my Mage Hand in front of her.
Wait, wa-wait!
Hold on!
It- it's fine!
Er, this mind flayer is with us!
We saved him, or he- he's our ally now; he's fine.
No one needs to fight.
He, uh, she's fine, he's fine.
His name is Clarota.
-speak Taliesin 
He's been an enormous help.
-speak Matt 
Without taking her eyes off of Clarota–
-speak Orion 
This is Kiva-
-speak Sam 
Kima.
-speak Orion 
Kima.
-speak Matt 
She looks back over - (laughs)
-speak Orion 
We are allies, all, yes?
-speak Matt 
Are you to tell me that you've come down here and allied yourself with an entity that is the anathema of the Mountain?
-speak Orion 
Yes!
-speak Travis 
Uh, what was that word?
-speak Liam 
I'm right at her shoulder, so I say, 
-speak Liam 
We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far.
-speak Matt 
And for what purpose?
You think they don't have plots lined out for weeks and months–
-speak Orion 
No, no, no!
Listen, listen-
-speak Matt 
–there is no trust to be had with these creatures.
-speak Liam 
He has been shit out by these creatures.
They do not want him or trust him.
He is an outcast.
And we are working together, in this moment, and without him we would not have gotten here.
-speak Laura 
We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye.
-speak Matt 
And with him you will never get out.
-speak Orion 
No!
We have his, er, alliance.
There's a greater entity controlling his people, which he has been outcast from, like Vax was saying!
-speak Matt 
And have you not thought for a second that perhaps all of you are being manipulated by this creature?
-speak Ashley 
Well, I have.
-speak Matt 
You can see the greatsword now flares with divine energy and she goes, 
-speak Matt 
I will not stand here and let us ally ourselves with this filth!
-speak Orion 
(shouting) 
-speak Orion 
Lady Kima!
-speak Orion 
And I blow fire breath.
And I use Control Flames to create a bunch of swords around me with fire.
-speak Laura 
Don't threaten Kima!
She's better.
-speak Orion 
(harshly) I give you my word.
-speak Matt 
Her attention divided from Clarota, now tends towards you.
-speak Orion 
Don't act me a fool, and don't treat me like one either!
None of us are half-wits as you are claiming.
We would not be fooled by such a creature like this.
The words he speaks are true.
And we believe him.
-speak Matt 
You go ahead and make a diplomacy check.
Or a persuasion.
Persuasion check.
-speak Laura 
Oh god!
-speak Liam 
Get it on, Tiberius!
-speak Travis 
Do it.
-speak Liam 
Get.
It.
On.
-speak Orion 
That's terrible.
-speak Liam 
Oh.
Get it off?
-speak Sam 
Not good.
-speak Laura 
Not good?
-speak Sam 
Not good!
-speak Orion 
12.
-speak Matt 
12.
Okay.
She walks towards you, and with each step, you can see the color of her eyes begins to vanish, giving way to an extremely bright, burning, silver light.
And she says–
-speak Laura 
(whispering) Oh my god, she's so cool!
-speak Matt 
Listen.
You come with me.
Without this creature!
Or you continue with it, and without me.
-speak Orion 
Why you have to be like that?
-speak Matt 
I will not walk beside this.
I have had its people devour mine since I set foot in here.
This creature, whatever its reasoning is, is not in your best interest.
It will lead you into a web of your own destruction!
I've seen their kind work.
-speak Liam 
Clarota!
-speak Orion 
Yeah, they're mostly buttholes, but he's not a butthole!
(all laugh)

-speak Orion 
I understand that -
-speak Liam 
Clarota!
-speak Orion 
- we had to kill a couple and he actually helped a lot!
-speak Liam 
Speak your mind!
Convince her.
Fix this.
-speak Matt 
Clarota, at the top of the stairs, you can see his tendrils in his mouth curl back in a sneer, his hands crossed before–
-speak Orion 
He won't even do anything!
-speak Matt 
–Clarota says, (gasping, breathy voice) 
-speak Matt 
Listen.
I am not going to walk where I am not welcome.
I will not wake up with this–
-speak Liam 
Giving us a Walking Dead decision.
-speak Matt 
–woman's blade in my back!
We made a deal.
-speak Marisha 
People with kids.
You deal with this all the time.
-speak Liam 
I walk between them and put hands out.
-speak Laura 
Come on, roll a 20!
-speak Liam 
And say, 
-speak Liam 
We all want the same thing.
Kima.
Tell us.
What is it that you've come here for?
What is your purpose here?
Speak your mind, if you are true.
-speak Matt 
Kima turns back towards you, the same glowing flare in her eyes.
-speak Matt 
I've come here to rid this mountain and this continent of the darkness that resides deep within the bowels of this thing's city!
-speak Liam 
Clarota, why have you come here.
What is it you seek?
-speak Matt 
Clarota settles into itself for a second.
-speak Matt 
Ah, I've come to destroy this creature K'Varn and free my people.
-speak Liam 
Then the two of you.
Get over your fucking shit.
(all laugh)

-speak Liam 
We want the same thing here.
Get over yourselves.
Both of you.
We share a common purpose.
We are going to end this fucking bullshit.
Kima, we have come here for you.
Pay us the respect that we have earned.
We have come a long way for you.
He is an unlikely ally, but he has gotten us to this point.
And together, for this moment and this moment only, we can work together.
We don't have to be school chums or buddies in a week from now.
But right now, right here, we will work together and achieve the same thing.
What say you, Kima?
-speak Matt 
She looks towards you and says, 
-speak Matt 
Free his people, he says.
What do you think will happen once his people are free?
Shall they let us walk out on our own?
-speak Orion 
Yes!
He said so!
And then they'll be buttholes when we leave!
-speak Matt 
You know so very little of these dark caverns, my dragon friend.
-speak Orion 
Yeah, it's our first time here!
-speak Matt 
These entities I watched steal the very life essence of the men and women I hired and travelled with for weeks down here.
I watched them capture them, and devour their very minds before me, and laugh and cackle as I fled into the shadows.
-speak Laura 
But they were under control of K'Varn at that point.
Yeah!
-speak Matt 
Oh!
Understand; whether or not K'Varn controls them to give them direction, they are of that type of mindset at all points.
They do not hope society will thrive.
They do not want us free peoples to walk the surface.
They want us for food.
-speak Sam 
Lady Kima, if I may.
If you're intending us to choose between you, and our ally Clarota, and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us, then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but to choose our own friend Clarota over you.
-speak Laura 
(gasps) What?
-speak Sam 
We're giving you one last chance.
Either you are with us, or you are against us.
This is a threat.
-speak Matt 
So you walk in here, save me from my binds, under the words of my dear, lifelong friend Arcanist Allura–
-speak Sam 
We mean you no ill will.
It is you who are aggravating the situation.
-speak Liam 
You could be sitting in a cell by yourself doing fuck-all, or ending this problem now.
-speak Matt 
Make a persuasion check.
-speak Marisha 
Everyone's giving her inspirational talks.
-speak Laura 
I'm so nervous!
Oh, Scanlan, come on!
-speak Sam 
Well, I rolled a three…
-speak Liam 
I rolled a 13.
-speak Sam 
But I have a plus 13!
So that's a 16.
-speak Liam 
Plus 13?
Three plus 13?
Okay.
-speak Ashley 
Plus, plus, uh… hold on.
(all laugh)

-speak Ashley 
Because, you didn't- where the fuck.
(all laugh)

-speak Ashley 
War God's Blessing!
-speak Matt 
Cleric flail!
-speak Ashley 
No, I can't do that, because that's when a person makes an attack roll.
(all laugh)

-speak Ashley 
Get 'em, Scanlan!
(all laugh)

-speak Taliesin 
Can I assist?
-speak Laura 
He assisted because he was talking–
-speak Matt 
Unfortunately, it's too late.
Once the roll–
-speak Sam 
No, he was with me, he was with me.
-speak Laura 
He assisted?
-speak Matt 
Right, right.
And because of that, the DC has been considered.
She takes a moment and steps forward.
She's a few inches taller than you.
-speak Sam 
Of course she is!
Everyone is!
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
And she looks at you, and says, 
-speak Matt 
He of the pretty voice.
I am grateful that all of you have come and traversed all this danger in my name, to free me from the binds that have held me.
And I do wish, very much, to walk alongside you to this end.
And I understand, it may be very well possible that this thing has taken your minds without your knowledge.
However–
-speak Matt 
And her eyes close for a second, and she opens them again, and that radiant spark of silver fades, and her normal eye color returns.
-speak Matt 
We see ourselves with little choices.
And I have very little allies at this point to achieve my goal.
-speak Laura 
(whispering) Oh, thank god.
-speak Matt 
If we are to travel together, this one must walk in step the entire time.
One single misstep, and I will not hesitate to carve that head from your body in the name of Bahamut.
-speak Orion 
I'm sorry.
Do you mean like dancing?
-speak Travis 
I will help you do that if he missteps.
-speak Matt 
Clarota, hands still crossed, takes a step down the stairs towards her.
Its tendrils in its mouth kind of– (slurping SFX) (breathy voice) 
-speak Matt 
And please, understand, if you ever intend to try and cut my life short, I will also not hesitate to bore that beautiful mind from your skull.
-speak Liam 
Once we murder this K'Varn, you guys are going to laugh so hard.
LAURA & MATT: (laugh)

-speak Sam 
So friends then?
-speak Orion 
Allies, allies.
-speak Travis 
Allies, allies.
-speak Laura 
Allies?
-speak Taliesin 
I suppose everybody understands everyone now.
-speak Orion 
Allies.
Clarota likes allies.
-speak Laura 
Good times.
-speak Liam 
The enemy of my enemy…
-speak Orion 
Is…
-speak Laura 
Is my…
-speak Sam 
Has mind-sucking tentacles.
-speak Matt 
She looks back at the rest of you and gives you all an understanding look and a nod and she says, 
-speak Matt 
I pray that you are right.
I pray that you're honest and I pray that through some strange will of the gods, this entity is telling the truth.
Because if it's not, none of us will make it out of here alive.
-speak Liam 
We're playing a game of chess here, Kima, and we will win.
-speak Laura 
I whisper in her ear: 
-speak Laura 
I would have chosen you.
-speak Sam 
And I start humming 'Kumbaya'.
(all laughing)

-speak Sam 
(singing softly) Kumbaya, my lord.
Kumbaya.
-speak Orion 
I take the dagger and make a happy face of fire.
-speak Matt 
She doesn't notice this, as she steps up the stairs towards Clarota.
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
Okay.
-speak Matt 
Clarota steps back, hands up in front, this little spark of arcane energy forming in his hands.
Clarota [sic], bringing the sword up in front of her, pushes Clarota aside and continues ascending back up the stairs to the first level.
(offscreen thump)

-speak Matt 
–To the first level.
(all laugh)

-speak Orion 
Killing two guards on the way.
-speak Matt 
Clarota puts the hands folded back together.
(unimpressed huff) (breathy voice) 
-speak Matt 
Shall we?
-speak Matt 
And walks up the stairs after her.
And you all begin to ascend back onto the first floor and that's where we'll end the game for this evening.
(Multiple groans and exclamations)

-speak Marisha 
What?
No.
What time is it?
I thought we just got started?
-speak Travis 
I thought we were going to have to pick.
We got like ten more minutes!
-speak Marisha 
Yeah, we have ten more minutes.
-speak Sam 
No, no, no.
That's fine, that's fine.
-speak Laura 
No, yeah, that is a good place, or we're going to get in a battle.
-speak Matt 
(chuckles) Depending on where you guys are going next it could be a bit of a lengthy encounter, so…
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
-speak Liam 
So the building is empty.
-speak Matt 
It's totally empty.
-speak Laura 
Completely empty.
-speak Liam 
There's ghouls everywhere.
-speak Matt 
There's nobody in there.
No one has any idea that you're here.
-speak Travis 
Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick between one or the other, who's picking Kima?
-speak Orion 
Oh, Kima?
-speak Travis 
Who's picking turtle-face?
-speak Liam 
I don't know.
-speak Orion 
She's Allura's friend, right?
-speak Travis 
We're going to throw down, this is gonna be Marvel versus DC in this bitch.
-speak Laura 
She's Allura's friend, she's good!
-speak Liam 
Undecided, I don't know.
-speak Laura 
Would you pick Kima?
-speak Travis 
Yeah!
-speak Laura 
Okay, yeah.
-speak Sam 
You just want her because she's badass and you could hump her.
-speak Travis 
Yeah!
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
Oh, Grog.
-speak Laura 
That would be the most awkward humping ever.
-speak Orion 
That's a good idea.
Grog!
You can go hump, I can get Allura.
-speak Liam 
She can hump your leg.
-speak Travis 
Did you see her work in that room of blood?
-speak Taliesin 
Only one of them is demanding that I become a liar.
-speak Marisha 
Isn't Kima a dwarf?
-speak Matt 
No, Kima is a halfling.
-speak Laura 
Kima is a halfling.
-speak Marisha 
Halfling?
-speak Liam 
She's a ropy, muscular, halfling.
-speak Ashley 
Wait, dang it!
I wanted to take some torture weapons!
-speak Matt 
You can go back if you want to.
-speak Ashley 
Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes and go get some torture weapons?
-speak Liam 
What's it for?
!
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
This would be pretty quick, you have to grab some things as everyone is heading up the stairs.
-speak Liam 
Who's your deity?
Harvey Keitel?
(More laughing)

-speak Ashley 
No!
Just for Grog!
-speak Matt 
So, Pike, the war priest, however, who the light of Sarenrae has guided her through her life, once a gifted being of light and joy, upon coming to the edge of death, her soul taken from her form and returned, going at sea and traveling with some of the more rough and tumble folks of the landscape, has returned now with her mind bent on war, vengeance–
-speak Travis 
Yeah!
-speak Matt 
–and what it means to win a battle, through force if necessary.
Watching Pike rush off and going to gather up what appear to be two large, bladed hooks–
-speak Ashley 
(hissing)
-speak Matt 
.
–a lengthy hand-razor–
-speak Taliesin 
Nice.
-speak Ashley 
Okay, wait, hold on.
Lengthy hand-razor…
-speak Marisha 
You're going to go Sweeney Todd all up in this shit.
-speak Laura 
(mimicking Ashley) Hold on, hold on.
Lengthy hand-razor.
(More laughter)

-speak Liam 
A Milli Vanilli album, and…
-speak Ashley 
Wait, what was the first one?
-speak Matt 
Two large, pointed hooks that are about two feet in length.
Almost like a bladed jai alai.
-speak Travis 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
And you gather a small bag of various instruments that are rusty and nasty.
-speak Laura 
Ew.
-speak Matt 
There is just some leather pouch and you put that in your bag.
It's all you have time to grab before you have to bolt back up to get to the rest.
-speak Taliesin 
(swishing SFX)
-speak Matt 
And we'll pick up the next game as you guys head up the stairs back into the hallway you first entered in the center of the Emberhold duergar stronghold, Lady Kima released and a very tentative alliance.
So, thank you guys all for watching.
-speak Ashley 
Whoo!
-speak Marisha 
Pain in the ass, Lady Kima.
Pain in my ass.
-speak Laura 
Hey.
-speak Zac 
Oh hey.
-speak Matt 
Hello, Zac!
-speak Zac 
I was doing my little pop-ins here.
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
-speak Zac 
So we had some donations to the charity.
-speak Matt 
Oh, that's awesome!
-speak Laura 
Really?
-speak Marisha 
Yeah!
-speak Marisha 
Thanks guys.
-speak Zac 
I have really terrible handwriting, so… So I wrote these myself and I'm supposed to read them and…
-speak Matt 
Right, right, that's okay.
-speak Zac 
TheConman93.
-speak Matt

-speak Matt 
We might just do that.
Awesome.
-speak Zac 
It's from sevem to nine we'll have a band playing, we're gonna do some fun group games.
Probably play some inappropriate Cards Against Humanity.
And Super Fight and stuff like that.
-speak Matt 
As if there was appropriate Cards Against Humanity.
-speak Zac 
Every time I break it out, I'm like, I should never do this.
(all laugh)

-speak Matt 
I know.
It's part of the fun.
And we're every Thursday, seven o'clock, 7PM Pacific Standard Time.
Usually we run about two and a half, three hours, our game sessions.
So please come watch every Thursday.
We love to have you guys.
-speak Zac 
And for Team Hooman tomorrow is Ify Appreciation Day.
So if you guys want to get on that.
And for those that know Ify as sholfboys and not much else, Ify is a really prominent figure in the local comedy scene and he does a lot of work on shows like Key & Peele, Comedy Bang!
Bang!
, stuff like that.
He's a really talented dude.
You should look him up before you write those tweets just so you know more of what he's about.
And we are going to throw that dropcam up and set up for dancing.
If any of you want to stay, you're welcome to.
If not, you're welcome to leave.
No one is going to force you, except chatroom now that I brought it up.
(all laugh)

-speak Ashley 
I mean, it's a good workout after all this food.
-speak Zac 
You burn some calories after all that chicken, right?
-speak Ashley 
Burn some calories…
-speak Laura 
Right, right.
-speak Matt 
Exactly.
-speak Zac 
We are, I think, 20 away from a giveaway.
So as long as we're live, the giveaway counts.
-speak Travis 
Is valid.
-speak Matt 
Exactly.
-speak Zac 
So, if you get 20 subs before we go offline we will ship this wherever you are in the world.
So, let's throw the dropcam up!
