-speak Matt 
Hello everyone!
Welcome to Critical Role tonight!
Last time, you managed to find yourselves in battle with two ogres.
Who were carrying some sort of strange, mutated, black ooze in a glass container.
The glass container was shattered, of course, by an explosive arrow created by Percy and fired by Vex.
-speak Laura 
Go us!
-speak Matt 
It led into a very rough battle with this strange mutating ooze.
Until through some good teamwork, crafty use of telekinesis and a nearby lava pool, you guys managed to survive the encounter.
-speak Travis 
Barely.
-speak Matt 
You then found that you had looped around back around to the large cavern, back to the warcamp and the lake.
Which allowed you to retrieve your bear Trinket.
-speak Laura 
Yeah! Trinket!
-speak Matt 
You guys begin to step down into the lower tunnels, dotted with trickling streams of magma.
-speak Scanlan 
I was just so out of it last time.
Have we rested?
-speak Vex 
We should probably rest.
-speak Scanlan 
Is this just a tunnel?
-speak Vex 
We're by that lake with the giant monster.
-speak Vax 
We circled all the way back around.
-speak Scanlan 
Oh shit.
-speak Vex 
And now we're headed down the lava tunnel.
Which you had said "There's no way we should go down the lava tunnel!"
Yeah, that's where we ended up.
-speak Matt 
You guys also just woke up about two, three hours ago.
Scanlan, you didn't take any damage, but you did cast several spells, I have them written here for you.
-speak Grog 
I'm ready. Who we fighting next?
-speak Scanlan 
Anyone need some healing?
Are we all okay? Are we all good?
-speak Pike 
I think we're all good.
Where's everybody at in terms ofâ€¦
-speak Vex 
On a personal level, or?
-speak Pike 
Yeah, just in life?
-speak Matt 
So, as you guys begin to push down into this lower chasm, the temperature grows steadily warmer and warmer.
A drier heat.
Especially those of you with thick armor, you find that sweat beads begin to trickle down the side of your face.
-speak Pike 
I'm sweating!
-speak Keyleth 
You're all glisteny!
-speak Matt 
Pooling and gathering in parts of your chestplate.
-speak Scanlan 
Pike, if you'd like me to hold your armor?
Take it off for a little while?
-speak Pike 
No, I'll keep it on just for safety.
-speak Scanlan 
Let it hang out a little bit?
Just saying, you might feel more comfortable with a loose fitting sort of cloak?
-speak Vex 
Scanlan, stop being creepy!
-speak Scanlan 
I'm not creepy!
I'm just trying to be mindful!
-speak Pike 
No, it's fine Scanlan.
-speak Grog 
Very considerate of you, a gentleman's offer.
-speak Pike 
Yeah, it's okay.
I'll keep it on.
-speak Scanlan 
I'll just have to use my imagination.
-speak Keyleth 
A gentleman's offer, yes.
That's what we'll call it from now on.
-speak Matt 
The sulfur smell is now getting stronger and stronger as you go deeper and deeper into this tunnel.
You go for 20 or 30 minutes deeper before the sweltering heat gets noticeably warmer.
You crest a slight incline and on the other side, you see a large portion of the path has collapsed down.
A gargantuan pool of magma is pooling into the tunnel, essentially covering half of the path.
It can be safely walked past at about two or three abreast.
Like 15 feet wide.
And the rest of it is just extremely bright, hot, molten rock.
-speak Laura 
Does it hurt us to get near it?
-speak Matt 
No, but it's uncomfortable.
You're very aware of watching your step.
-speak Liam 
I would just like to point out that we're nine adults playing don't touch the hot lava at the moment.
-speak Scanlan 
Keyleth, if it gets hotter than this?
You don't have any way of getting some water out here?
-speak Keyleth 
Yeah, I can make water.
I've got you covered.
-speak Laura 
Can I use my tracking?
To see if any duergar have passed through the area?
With favoured terrain, I know their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
-speak Matt 
You take a moment, inspecting the way the terrain's been pushed and the dirt has been shoved aside.
Tracking footprints and scuff marks on the rock and the walls nearby.
Seeing if any of the flows have been interrupted recently, and you ascertain that there is actually a pretty continuous patrol through here.
About once every 4 to 8 hours, there's a group of 5 to 10 duergar.
Sometimes other, larger creatures.
You find footprints that are ogres, some troll footprints.
You also notice some of the walls have what looks like small, localized cave-ins.
Almost as if something had burrowed through at one time or another.
So, there's also things that exist outside of the tunnel system.
-speak Laura 
So, as quickly as possible, we should get through these tunnels, I assume?
-speak Matt 
Probably a good idea.
You continue tracking down this tunnel, and it takes you a good 3 or 4 hours to finally reach where the tunnel begins to widen up.
You assess that, maybe three miles up, there is some kind of town.
Or, at least, a population of duergar amassed in a central place.
-speak Travis 
Should we be stealthing?
-speak Laura 
We should probably start stealthing at this point, yes.
-speak Liam 
I was about to say I'd like to move ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along.
-speak Matt 
Let's do that! Go ahead and roll stealth.
This would be a group stealth check.
-speak Liam 
26. I've tiptoed away.
-speak Sam 
19.
-speak Marisha 
15.
-speak Taliesin 
7.
-speak Travis 
17.
-speak Ashley 
7.
-speak Laura 
20.
-speak Matt 
Picking up on the shortcomings of a handful of members of your group, you do manage to make a fairly stealthy advance.
About an hour and a half of travel, you eventually get to a point where the tunnel shoots open into a gargantuan cavern.
A chamber nearly a mile and a half across from this visual point.
It is extremely tall, with hundreds of very jagged stalagmites hanging from the ceiling.
And rock formations that rise and fall at different points of the topography.
This entire tunnel has this strange downward curve that disappears out of sight about a mile ahead and to the left.
-background kraghammer  
-continue 
But this huge tunnel is lit by more than 30 small lava falls.
-background kraghammer
-continue 
You also see some small pockets of that red glow stone that a lot of these Dwarven tunnels tend to use as a light source.
The entire landscape is rough and craggy, with large black obsidian spikes jutting out of the ground.
It's a very unwelcoming atmosphere.
The sulfurous smell is extremely strong.
Across the chamber, you see a small cluster of buildings, with similar construction to the war camp.
20 to 25 structures, punctuated with 7 black obsidian watchtowers.
-speak Liam 
Still natural?
-speak Matt 
No, these are constructed.
These are very smooth, rigid Dwarvish construction with a jagged edge.
The one that you can see closest to you, a quarter mile off, you can just barely make out a couple of duergar.
Walking across one of the upper levels.
And also some sort of ballistae.
-speak Laura 
This is where Kima's being held.
-speak Matt 
You see a gargantuan ebony fortress.
Serrated stonework marks the top of each wall and more of these giant bolt-throwers are mounted across the parapets.
A massive magma fall descends from the rocky ceiling.
Right above the stronghold, split in two by its roof.
Each flow continues off eithe side, buttressing the stronghold almost as a defense mechanism.
Like they built it intentionally underneath this magma fall.
-speak Scanlan 
Wow.
-speak Vex 
Oh, that's where the trapdoor is!
-speak Vax 
Do you recall any of the details from your vision, from your dreams?
-speak Pike 
I've definitely been here in my vision.
All of this looks familiar, and I think we're in the right place.
-speak Vex 
Sweet.
-speak Matt 
The giant building you see is called Emberhold.
That's what it's been referred to as.
-speak Liam 
From our vantage point can we see the two lava flows that we were warned about?
-speak Matt 
It is way too far away.
That stronghold is probably a good mile and a half away from you right now.
-speak Laura 
Is there any cover as we cross the cavern?
-speak Matt 
There is a good bit of cover.
But it's a lot of open area with cover.
So you're going to have to be careful as you move through.
-speak Scanlan 
Percy.
-speak Percy 
Yes?
-speak Scanlan 
How long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon?
-speak Percy 
A very long time.
If I start it right now.
-speak Marisha 
I'm actually gonna go ahead and cast Pass Without A Trace.
-speak Scanlan 
What does that do?
-speak Keyleth 
It makes us really stealthy.
-speak Scanlan 
Oh, cool!
-speak Matt 
You've seen this before.
As she finishes her incantation, you feel the darkness of the shadows around you begin to coalesce and almost stick to you.
Its now much easier to slip into the surrounding shadows.
-speak Travis 
And I'm doing my flower girl routine with the dust of tracelessness.
-speak Liam 
We need to get closer up.
We need to find this trap door, because it's suicide going in the front.
-speak Laura 
And Lady Kima's being held here.
-speak Sam 
So there's an entrance to this trap door that possibly is on the outskirts of the city?
-speak Laura 
Yes, so we're headed left.
-speak Liam 
The twins will creep ahead.
-speak Travis 
Yeah, keep creeping, keep creeping.
Me and Trinket are telling jokes in the back of the group.
-speak Sam 
Quietly.
-speak Marisha 
Classic Trinket.
-speak Matt 
You guys continue. 
You can see a path, or at least where most of the patrols walk along.
A natural road has been created over time.
You avoid that and steer off to the left, dodging between the various bits of terrain.
And it's a very rocky and difficult terrain.
Should you not be with your ranger, who has the Underdark as her favored terrain.
As you guys begin to curve around the left, everyone roll a perception check real fast.
-speak Marisha 
16.
-speak Taliesin 
24.
-speak Travis 
9.
-speak Ashley 
19.
-speak Laura 
20.
-speak Liam 
25.
-speak Matt 
Both Percy and Vax simultaneously put their arms out to hold everyone back.
As you hear a slight distant clanking of metal and voices.
Low, conversational.
Too far for you to listen at this point.
But you all immediately stop.
You hear a roving patrol of duergar, a good 70, 80 feet away.
Heading up the path you guys had just began to skirt around.
-speak Percy 
Let them pass.
-speak Scanlan 
Why don't we create a distraction and get rid of them?
-speak Matt 
No one's seen them, you can just hear them.
No one's gone to check.
-speak Laura 
Oh! Can I look?
-speak Liam 
Yes, let's go look.
-speak Keyleth 
Can we not just hide?
-speak Matt 
Just the two of you?
-speak Percy 
They're taking the path that we're not on, right?
So, if we hideâ€“
-speak Vex 
They won't find us.
Potentially.
But I want to hear what they're saying.
-speak Keyleth 
We'll all hide.
-speak Grog 
Well, we could just get this party started right here, if we want to.
-speak Vax 
Why don't we go just up ahead and scout?
-speak Vex 
Just a little bit ahead and see what we can see.
-speak Matt 
The twins slink between the various rock formations and strange, jagged spires that pepper this entire underground landscape.
You get up to a point where you're maybe 10 feet from the road.
You can see the roving band of duergar.
-show duergar 6
-showanother duergar 9
-showanother duergar 12
-showanother duergar 7.5
-showanother duergar 10.5
-continue
You count, at quick glance, roughly 12 to 15.
Armed with hammers, and halberds.
Both of you guys roll a perception check right now.
-speak Liam 
26.
-speak Laura 
17.
-show duergar_caster 3
-speak Matt 
One of them is unarmed.
He's completely bald, with a extremely long, well sculpted, black goatee beard that streams down.
Thick black and red trimmed robes.
He looks extremely dangerous.
You pick up bits and pieces of their conversation as they pass by.
-speak Duergar 
Well, keep your eyes peeled, eh.
That thing is still out there.
-speak Duergar 
Horek says that it ate a whole scouting party in seconds.
-speak Duergar 
Listening to Horek was your first mistake.
Shut up and keep walking.
-speak Duergar 
I mean, if that one went crazy, well, can't the other ones crack, too?
I don't know if I feel safe around any of K'varn's pets anymore at this rate.
-hide duergar
-hide duergar_caster
-speak Matt 
And by that point, their voices begin to fade, as they continue on.
-speak Laura 
So, we walk back.
-speak Vex 
There's a lot of them.
We don't want to fight them if we don't have to.
Secondly, there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose and is very, very bad.
It's killed multiple duergar already.
-speak Scanlan 
No indication of what kind of a creature it was?
-speak Vex 
No, but it might be the thing we already killed.
It could've been the naga thing that showed up in the camp, I don't know.
-speak Laura  
Should we keep moving forward at a very stealthy sort of pace?
-speak Liam  
Let's do it.
-speak Matt 
Certainly.
You guys push forward, keeping a wide berth.
Which adds a fair amount of time to your travel, as you're being careful and moving in an arc around the duergar city.
You're just starting to get to the point where you can see the front of the fortress.
From this distance, the magma fall looks like a solid curtain on each side.
But it does split up at certain points, you can begin to start making it out.
-speak Taliesin 
Where does the magma runoff lead to?
Does it fill a moat?
-speak Matt 
It's hard to tell from this distance, unfortunately.
It's at this point, Vex, you notice one of the nearby obsidian spires is a different color than the rest.
The rest are like a deep black, glass shiny color.
This one is a dull crimson.
-speak Vex 
Ooh! We should go towards that one.
-speak Scanlan 
Because it's a different color?
-speak Vax 
Let's go check it out.
-speak Liam 
The twins are gonna go have a peek.
-speak Sam 
I'm coming with.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
-speak Sam 
Oh boy. Not my strong suit.
-narrate 
Sam rolls, and immediately pulls a face of "oops" when he sees the result.
-speak Travis 
Don't fuck it up.
-speak Laura 
No, Scanlan, what did you do?
-speak Liam 
You dick!
-speak Travis 
Did you?
-speak Marisha 
What did you do?
-speak Ashley 
Wait, wait, I go and I grab Scanlan and I kiss him on the cheek and make him stay.
-speak Laura 
Oooh!
-speak Taliesin 
Way to take one for the team.
-speak Travis 
I don't know.
-speak Ashley 
Can I roll persuasion?
-speak Marisha 
Can you roll a persuasion against a critical fail?
Can you? Can you persuade a crit fail?
-speak Laura 
Can you persuade the DM?
-speak Marisha 
Can you persuade the DM!
-speak Sam 
It was a one.
-speak Liam 
That's a one face.
-speak Matt 
I will say, Pike, roll a perception check.
-speak Ashley 
14?
-speak Matt 
Unfortunately, you're not quite perceptive enough to notice Scanlan walking away.
Scanlan, you continue with the twins, absentmindedly humming to yourself.
The twins, being used to your humming, for some reason it doesn't connect.
You make your way up to the spire.
You notice why the coloration is different.
It is completely coated in dried blood.
-speak Liam 
Fuck.
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
-speak Matt 
And immediately to the right of it, there appears to be an arm.
The ground around also just covered in dried blood.
-speak Marisha 
An arm?
-speak Vex 
Scanlan. Shh.
-speak Scanlan 
What? What?
-speak Vex 
You're singing.
-speak Scanlan 
I was singing?
I didn't even know! It's a force of habit!
-speak Liam 
Can I do a scan to see if whatever did this is still nearby?
-speak Matt 
Make an investigation check.
-speak Liam 
7.
-speak Laura 
Can I check it out as well?
21.
-speak Matt 
The state of the blood that you see around seems to indicate that this has transpired over some time.
You're guessing probably a few days, if not a week, since this happened.
-speak Liam 
I'm picking up the arm to bring back to the group.
-speak Matt 
Okay, so as you walk up towards the arm, you get more of a view of what's happened.
Against these rocky formations there's dried blood everywhere.
This terrible bloodbath, it would have been a horrible thing to see.
There are pieces of duergar flung about.
Occasionally you see part of a head, or part of a foot.
And you recognize the ashy skin from the areas that aren't caked in gore.
Because of your investigation check, you can tell this wasn't done with a blade.
There's no cuts, no clean wounds.
They were pulled apart by force.
Arms and limbs wrenched from the body by sheer power.
-speak Travis 
Like a Wookiee.
-speak Matt 
There was also some gnawing, some chewing.
Sharp teeth have partially eaten portions of these bodies.
-speak Vax 
This is the work of a beaver.
-speak Vex 
Yes, definitely, a very large beaver.
-speak Scanlan 
I think it's suicide.
-speak Laura 
Can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby?
Or if it's gone?
-speak Matt 
It happened quite some time ago.
Looking at the tracks, you can see mostly duergar feet.
However, there's a series of tracks that you haven't seen.
Very erratic footsteps, similiar in size to your own.
But they seem to be placed randomly, like one foot here, one foot here, one foot there.
-speak Vex 
It's something stitched together.
-speak Matt 
And you see what seem like strange furrows in the sand.
Like someone had been dragged, but only for a short distance.
Scattered all about.
-speak Vax 
It's a human centipede.
-speak Scanlan 
Definitely.
-speak Matt 
It's a very strange pattern that you can't really grasp what kind of creature would make it.
-speak Laura 
And it seems like it was here recently, or a while ago?
-speak Matt 
Best you can tell, the last time it was here was about two or three days ago, to feast on more of the remains.
-speak Laura 
Is there anything to loot?
-speak Matt 
Any semblance of armor that belonged to any of these individuals is in such tatters that it's unusable.
You do manage to find, across some of the body parts, a couple of blood-soaked gold coin purses.
-speak Laura 
I like gold.
-speak Matt 
One of them contains a handful of gems.
-speak Laura 
Ooh!
-speak Matt 
Yes, those right there.
So you can mark that down, until you get a chance to appraise them.
-speak Vax 
I don't think we want to tangle with this.
What are we trying to prove?
Let's just keep trucking.
-speak Scanlan 
I'm really bad at stealthing, we should go.
-speak Vax 
Also, put the accordion back in the bag, all right?
-speak Scanlan 
Was I doing that?
It's force of habit, it's like breathing.
-speak Liam 
Yeah, we're going to go back to the group, I'm going to bring the arm.
-speak Travis 
I take out the cask of ale and pour a little tankard of ale, just because I'm bored.
-speak Ashley 
Have a sip sip.
-speak Matt 
It's very tasty.
-speak Grog 
Would anyone else like a sip?
Keyleth?
-narrate 
Marisha, Taliesin and Ashley all mime drinking the ale.
-speak Matt 
Having been underground for what probably amounts now to four or five days, that little taste of ale on your lips is a very welcoming and very refreshing sensation.
-speak Grog 
It's good shit, right?
-speak Pike 
Oh, delicious.
Oh no, I'm drunk!
Just kidding.
That was fast!
-speak Liam 
When we get back to the group, I'm going to toss the arm to Grog.
-speak Matt 
Grog, you instinctively reach up and catch it.
You look down and see what looks like a duergar arm that has been very heavily mangled.
-speak Grog 
Oh! Thanks for the hand!
-speak Vax 
It's a back scratcher.
-speak Vex 
There's a big centipede-y human, creepy creature that's killed a lot of things and we should probably avoid that at all costs.
-speak Vax 
If we have to fight it, we will, butâ€“
-speak Percy 
That seems fair.
-speak Vex 
Can we avoid that and still head left of the keep?
-speak Matt 
I mean, you haven't seen the creature.
-speak Liam 
Let's keep moving.
-speak Ashley 
Keep trucking on.
-speak Scanlan 
Pike, I have this weird feeling, like you wanted to make out with me.
Is that something that happened?
Am I dreaming?
-speak Pike 
Well, you just, you know, you weren't paying attention.
-speak Scanlan 
Really?
-speak Vex 
And that makes you want to make out with him?
-speak Pike 
No, I think you were moving along to try to go stealth.
And sometimes you should just stay put and see what happens.
-speak Vax 
That was the most adorable diss in history.
-speak Percy 
That was cold.
-speak Scanlan 
All right.
-speak Grog 
It's all right, Scanlan.
We'll go pay for it later.
-speak Matt 
A small hit to Scanlan's morale, but the party marches on.
-speak Sam 
I deserved it, I deserved it.
-speak Liam 
Okay, twins in front, here we go.
-speak Matt 
Twins in front.
You guys continue to push forward.
For the sake of the length of this journey, I'm going to have the party go ahead and roll a communal stealth check once more.
-speak Marisha 
I still have Pass Without A Trace up.
Which gives everyone a plus 10.
-speak Laura 
Oh, really!?
-speak Taliesin 
Oh, for the love of god.
I rolled a 1.
-speak Vax 
Percy! Don't bang the guns together.
-speak Sam 
I kiss Percy!
-speak Percy 
What! Ah!
-speak Scanlan 
I don't know!
I thought it might help.
Is that bubblegum?
-speak Sam 
19.
-speak Marisha 
23.
-speak Travis 
26.
-speak Ashley 
13.
-speak Laura 
30.
-speak Liam 
32.
-speak Matt 
Okay, good.
More than half you guys succeeded. That bit is key.
You manage to make your way about a quarter mile past this cluster of buildings.
Curving far left, you're managing to keep out of the city proper.
Getting towards the very back wall of this cavern, which this fortress is built against.
Circumventing the city to get straight to the fortress.
About a quarter mile from the stronghold, Vex, you notice someone, standing about 50, 60 feet ahead of you.
-speak Laura 
Just a person?
-speak Matt 
Looks like.
-speak Laura 
Does it look like they can see us?
-speak Matt 
You take a moment, keeping an eye out, and the person isn't moving.
Just standing right there.
-speak Vex 
There's a person standing right there.
-speak Keyleth 
What?
-speak Vex 
A person.
He's just standing there.
-speak Matt 
It's too dark to make out any details, unfortunately.
-speak Vex 
Hmm.
-speak Scanlan 
Could be good, could be bad.
We have no idea.
-speak Liam 
Can I see him now that she's pointed him out to me?
-speak Scanlan 
I can hold him. Might piss him off.
-speak Vax 
It doesn't seem to be moving, though.
-speak Vex 
Maybe it's a scarecrow?
-speak Vax 
Maybe it's a statue.
-speak Scanlan 
Want me to go check it out?
-speak Vax 
No! I don't!
-speak Scanlan 
I can go invisible.
-speak Vex 
Go invisible and check it out.
-hide scanlan
-speak Sam 
I polymorph and turn into a fly and I buzz over.
-speak Vax 
Good job, gnome nuts.
-speak Matt 
As you get closer, it is unmoving and grey in color.
-speak Laura 
It's a statue.
-speak Matt 
A mind flayer, completely turned to stone.
-speak Laura 
Oh no!
-speak Marisha 
Oh shit.
-speak Sam 
Like a Medusa type of a thing?
-speak Liam 
We faced basilisks once and they did this to Vex'ahlia.
-speak Travis 
We've got basilisk eggs.
-speak Marisha 
There's a lot of things that can do this, actually, to be fair.
-speak Laura 
We do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding.
-speak Travis 
Yeah, we've got eight of them.
Maybe we should crack one on statue guy.
-speak Sam 
I buzz back to the group.
And I turn back.
-show scanlan -8
-speak Grog 
Well, what did you see?
-speak Vex 
What was it?
-speak Scanlan 
A crazy statue of a crazy illithid.
-speak Vax 
That's crazy.
-speak Vex 
Clarota, do you know anything about this?
-speak Clarota  
Occasionally these patrols do walk with a lizard creature that has this ability.
-speak Keyleth 
So the duergar have basilisks.
-speak Clarota  
A trained beast, yes.
-speak Vax 
Why do you suppose they used it on one of their own?
-speak Clarota  
I can only imagine maybe this transpired before the union and is left as a warning.
-speak Matt 
As you guys push forward, Clarota lags behind a little bit to inspect the statue.
-speak Laura 
Did you know him?
-speak Clarota  
Uhâ€¦
-speak Scanlan 
Dave.
-speak Matt 
Goddamn it!
He takes a moment to look over and you can see his eyes close slightly for a second.
-speak Clarota  
Aye, we've met.
Not the kindest of my people, but, nevertheless, should all this pass, I would like to, maybe, release him from this stony prison.
-speak Vex 
So you know how to do that?
-speak Clarota  
I know not, but it can be done.
I've seen it.
-speak Vex 
Didn't we do that?
-speak Vax 
We sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes, if I remember correctly.
When you turned to stone.
-speak Travis 
We don't have any more of that.
-speak Matt 
You do not.
-speak Liam 
We also don't know if it's a basilisk.
-speak Laura 
Let's just keep going.
-speak Matt 
After another 20 minutes, you get a much better view of the Emberhold.
You can see where the magma fall splits.
Most of it flowing towards the front of the fortress and a thinner stream towards the very back.
-speak Laura 
Thin one!
-speak Travis 
Yeah, let's go towards the door.
-speak Laura 
Creepy, creepy, creepy towards the thin one.
-speak Liam 
The creeps are creeping.
-speak Matt 
So you move ahead of the rest of the group and head to the front of this stream.
There's a frame of cooled rock around the base of the fall.
The stream falls directly against the side of the stronghold, a sheer wall of rock.
-speak Liam 
I know this all looks natural, but perhaps something is fashioned to look such.
I want to see if I can figure that out.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make an investigate check.
-speak Liam 
18.
-speak Matt 
You cannot see anything before you.
No mechanism, button, lever, or doorway.
It's just a solid wall, with the two magma flows.
-speak Liam 
I double back for the Underdark expert and I bring my sister up.
-speak Laura 
Can I come up and look and see if I can see any tracking?
If there's any footprints around a certain area.
Go ahead and make an investigate check.
-speak Laura 
22.
-speak Matt 
You can see what amounts to a very, very slight raise in the smooth flow of magma.
It seems to pour down along the side of the stronghold and then slightly bulges out.
And then it pools, and you can now see where it runs off to.
It continues on, following the edge of the cavern wall.
Curving down and to the left into a far deeper cavern.
-speak Laura 
Does it look like it's safe to bring everybody up here?
Are there any look-outs?
-speak Matt 
You glance up and you can see there are two duergar perched on the wall above you.
The parapet is lined with jagged, obsidian stones.
Almost teeth, sticking out of the very top edge of the wall.
-speak Scanlan 
We're going to have to 007 sniper them out.
-speak Keyleth 
I think I can get us into that trap door.
-speak Scanlan 
If you redirect the magma with a Wall of Stone?
-speak Keyleth 
I was thinking I could-
That's actually a better idea.
-speak Matt 
That's fucking teamwork.
-speak Keyleth 
Or I could, or I was thinking I could cool off the magma and we could break it.
-speak Vax 
That sounds kind of noisy.
-speak Sam 
First we've got to take care of the guys on the roof.
Are they back with us, or are they still stealthing in front?
-speak Matt 
They're still stealthing in front, and you guys have come back to the group?
-speak Liam  
Yeah, I guess we came back to the group and told them about what's going on.
-speak Scanlan 
Pike and I can take out the guys on the roof.
-speak Vex 
Oh really?
-speak Grog 
Yeah! Do it!
-speak Pike 
You want to give it a go?
-speak Grog 
Why don't we let the little people have some fun?
It's been over an hour, we've killed nothing, we'll kill these fucks!
-speak Travis 
I'm a vampire. I need blood.
-speak Sam 
I'm going to just look at the guard's pattern of movement.
Are they staying in position, or are they walking around?
-speak Matt 
As you watch, two are chatting for a second, then a third one appears.
Then one of them rotates out for the one that just arrived.
-speak Ashley 
They were switching shifts.
-speak Matt 
They both just sit there, keeping an eye.
One of them cleans his bow.
-speak Scanlan 
You ready?
Do you know what you're going to do up there?
-speak Pike 
Not really, but let's just wing it!
-speak Scanlan 
I'm going to try to knock them both off in one blow, but if I miss, you gotta take one.
-speak Grog 
Morningstar to the taint.
-speak Scanlan 
Grog, you ready to kill?
-speak Grog 
Yeah, oh yeah!
-speak Percy 
This is awesome and nothing is going to go wrong.
-speak Keyleth 
Why are we using the gnomes to throw people over?
-speak Scanlan 
We're little people!
You know why?
Because I need someone with me and I can only take her.
Because she's the only one small enough to fit through the Dimension Door with me.
-speak Pike 
The Dimension Door?
-speak Scanlan 
Yes, we're going to go through a Dimension Door.
I can take one person of my height or smaller.
So I will take Pike.
-speak Liam 
Portal, motherfucker!
-speak Matt 
You reach over and hold on to Pike gently, give her a little wink.
-speak Sam 
We're going to try to appear between the two of them.
Exactly between the two of them.
-speak Matt 
You feel the sudden rush of air.
You go from that uncomfortable warmth to a sudden freezing cold,
Your vision goes black.
Scanlan, you grin as you mutter these arcane incantations under his breath.
An instant later, you guys are both standing at the top of the wall.
Next to the duergar, one facing away, one looking really surprised at the fact that you guys both appeared there.
You have a surprise round.
What are you doing?
-speak Sam 
I cast Thunderwave and blast out from where I'm standing between them, 15 feet in either direction.
-speak Laura 
That's so loud!
-speak Marisha 
Isn't that loud?
-speak Liam 
But a quiet Thunderwave, right?
-speak Matt 
Thunderwave, looking it up real fast just to make sure of the situation.
-speak Travis 
I like this plan.
-speak Liam 
~This is a triumph.~
-speak Ashley 
~I'm making a note here.~
-speak Everyone  
~Huge success.~
-speak Matt 
Here we go.
-speak Sam 
I don't think it's loud.
-speak Liam 
We're total fake geeks, all of us.
-speak Sam 
It's a wave of thunderous force, but it doesn't say sound.
It just says thunderous force.
-speak Matt 
It's gonna make some noise.
So keep that in mind.
You bring your arms up and slam your arms downwards.
As you do, there is a dull flash of light and a boom emanates from you.
The duergar who sees you, who is bringing us his crossbow to fire, gets impacted and blown off the side of the wall.
The one facing away slams into the side of the wall, right at the edge.
And then topples over the side, both plummeting over.
-speak Liam 
Wilhelm scream!
-speak Pike 
Oh!
-speak Matt 
Pike, you're standing there, you watch this happen.
-speak Pike 
I didn't have to do anything, Scanlan!
-speak Scanlan 
Make out with me!
We're alone, it's super romantic.
I just killed two fuckers!
Come on!
It's now or never, baby!
-speak Travis 
~I think we're alone now~
-speak Ashley 
~Doesn't seem to be anyone around!~
-speak Pike 
Well, let's just wait until we're out of danger.
-speak Marisha  
Yeah, it's getting real romantic real quick, Scanlan.
-speak Scanlan 
Wait?
-speak Pike 
But that was really hot!
-speak Scanlan 
It was really hot, right?
Come on!
-speak Pike 
It was.
-speak Scanlan 
Just a little something something?
-speak Pike 
Let's justâ€“
-speak Matt 
As this is happening, both of the duergar come plummeting off the side of the wall.
One manages to kind of loosely break his fall.
-speak Laura 
Get ready.
-speak Liam 
Come on, Grog.
-speak Travis 
I rage!
-speak Matt 
There's one that lands just to the side of the magma pool that's forming.
He took some damage, and is trying to get back up.
He fell hard.
The other one managed to reduce his damage a little bit because it was aware at least you were there.
-speak Sam 
We have to kill these fuckers.
-narrate 
Travis laughs eagerly.
-speak Matt 
As he's trying to get back up, he looks up and sees Grog charging towards him.
Go ahead and make your two attacks.
-speak Laura 
Yes!
-speak Travis 
Two 19s! 36 damage!
-speak Matt 
He goes for his warhammer.
Before he gets a chance to, you cleave off one arm.
A second blow, the axe goes right into the center of his torso.
Silencing him in an instant.
You kick him off the edge of your axe.
-speak Marisha 
Can I just run to the other duergar and push him in the lava?
-speak Matt 
Roll athletics.
-speak Keyleth 
This is the meanest thing I've ever done!
-speak Vex 
No, no, remember you killed that kid one time.
-speak Keyleth 
Oh, thanks for bringing that up, Vax!
-speak Vex 
I'm Vex, he's Vax!
-speak Travis 
That's some dark shit!
-speak Marisha 
Every time I get confused.
-speak Pike 
Oh my god.
Remember you killed that kid one time?
-speak Vax 
Two and a half years in and Keyleth has just learned our names.
-speak Keyleth 
I get them confused.
-speak Scanlan 
I do too.
All the time.
-speak Pike and Grog  
All the time.
-speak Keyleth 
See, no one else has any idea!
-speak Vax 
I'm Vex, okay? It's simple!
-speak Scanlan 
No, no! That is not true!
-speak Vex 
No, no, don't do that.
He's lying.
-speak Marisha 
Two years, and I just don't.
-speak Keyleth 
This is for that kid!
-speak Liam 
~He had it coming, he had it coming.~
-speak Marisha 
14 for athlethics?
-speak Matt 
He rolled a 1.
-speak Laura 
Ooh! Yes!
-speak Matt 
You just run up and boom, shove him!
He falls back and lets out this horrible, painful scream.
As he's essentially flailing in the magma, melting.
-speak Ashley 
Someone shoot him in the mouth.
-speak Keyleth 
Shh! Shh! Shh!
-speak Marisha 
And I wind down to push him under the lava!
-speak Ashley 
Oh, this is brutal!
-speak Matt 
As he's screaming your Wind Wall shoves him further under the magma.
Cooling the magma around him as the rock solidifies.
-speak Keyleth 
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
-speak Matt 
His face still visible over the surface, this horrible, Han-in-carbonite look.
-speak Vex 
Keyleth!
-speak Vax 
You just one-upped Grog, man.
-speak Grog 
That was awesome!
-speak Matt 
Fresh magma begins to cover his face as you step away.
-speak Scanlan 
Piss on the body!
-speak Grog 
I never knew you were an artist.
-narrate 
Marisha laughs in shock.
-speak Matt 
Scanlan and Pike, you can hear footsteps coming towards you guys.
What are you going to do?
-speak Laura 
Run! Or can you turn yourselves into duergar?
-speak Sam 
Is there a door or something?
-speak Matt 
Not from your current position, no.
-speak Sam  
I'll do the same thing to get us down.
-speak Matt 
So you grab her, and bamf back down to the bottom.
-speak Travis 
Cast that shit.
-speak Matt 
They reappear at the bottom.
-speak Marisha 
Okay, I cast Wall of Stone, but right over top of where I see the bulge.
But I don't want to bring it out far.
Just like, halfsies.
-speak Sam 
Just the tip.
-speak Ashley 
Does it stop the magma?
-speak Matt 
There's this grinding sound of shifting rock.
A giant stone wall comes jutting out of the side of the fortress.
It diverts the lava flow, leaving a small gap.
Right underneath where it was, there is a stone doorway.
It does not appear to have a handle or anything, it's just a stone door.
-speak Scanlan 
How do we get in?
-speak Liam 
Can I take a look at it?
-speak Matt 
In the time you've taken to do this, both the duergar up on top have seen you, and are both taking shots at you.
-speak Sam 
Oh shit.
-speak Taliesin 
I was waiting for that.
-speak Laura 
Oh, I would have been too.
-speak Matt 
As they appear on the top, you guys who have your arrow and gun at the ready, take your shots first.
-speak Laura 
25 to hit, and 18 to hit, 33 damage total.
-speak Taliesin 
I've got the big gun out. Bad news.
23 to hit for 7 damage.
I'm so embarrassed.
-speak Matt 
Bad News fires with a cacophonous echoing gunshot.
Suprise may be a little harder to find going forward.
-speak Taliesin 
They were ready to start shooting at us.
-speak Matt 
Your bullet hits the guy in the shoulder, knocks him off balance for a second.
Not enough of a wound to prevent his next action.
Vex places an arrow directly into the other duergar's shoulder, making him drop his crossbow.
As he goes to reach for it, your other arrow goes into his throat and out the other side. 
He just drops below the wall.
-speak Ashley 
Awesome.
-speak Matt 
The other one does get a crossbow shot off at Percy.
23 to hit will do 9 points of piercing damage.
As the bolt just glances you.
Vax, you've been inspecting the door.
The door is not magical.
There is some sort of contraption that opens it from the inside.
-speak Liam 
I'm getting my picks out, seeing if I can figure out some way to get it open.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a check with your thieves' tools.
-speak Liam 
29.
-speak Matt 
The contraption that moves this door is definitely on the other side.
It's a series of winches, some chains.
You find that there is one slight gap where you manage to hook one of the chains.
Pull it out ever so slightly.
You know with a yank from someone strong, you could probably pull it from the outside.
-speak Grog 
Sounds like we need a strong person.
-speak Vax 
Grog, grab thisâ€“
-speak Pike 
I'll do it!
-speak Grog 
Yeah, me and Pike are on this.
-speak Pike 
I'll assist.
-speak Matt 
Grog, you reach over and grab the chain, and Pike grabs onto the back of you and you both pull.
-speak Travis 
Give it a good heave-ho.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a strength check with advantage.
-speak Travis 
23.
-speak Matt 
As you pull, you hear the grinding of this chain against the stone, and you can see the actual door begin to rise upward towards you.
-speak Sam 
It's a Delorean.
-speak Matt 
Essentially.
When it opens up, it moves the magma out of the way.
That's how this construct is used as an exit.
This is supposed to be an exit for the royals living in the stronghold.
It only opens part way, however, because the stone wall blocks it.
But open enough for you to get into the stronghold.
-speak Liam 
We can't leave this duergar behind though, we gotta take him out.
-speak Matt 
Yes, there is one duergar still there.
Pike, you haven't gone yet.
He's up on top of the wall, about 25 feet from you.
-speak Ashley 
I want to create a spiritual weapon, like a poisonous lasso.
And pull him down into the lava.
-speak Matt 
Huh. Sure.
-speak Travis 
That's awesome.
-speak Taliesin 
Well, all right then.
-speak Matt 
You take a moment, you grasp your Sarenrae holy symbol around your neck.
As you pull your hand away from the symbol, you see this glowing celestial rope extends out of nowhere.
It begins to swirl and swirl.
You throw your hand forward, and it cascades upward toward the edge of the wall.
Go ahead and make an attack roll.
-speak Ashley 
10.
-speak Sam 
Ooh. That ain't gonna do it.
-speak Matt 
Total of 10?
-speak Ashley 
I think so.
I rolled a two, and then I have a plus eight.
-speak Liam 
It was a good idea though.
-speak Laura 
It was such a good idea.
-speak Matt 
You also get the feeling poison is something you probably can't really muster.
Just based on your deity.
-speak Ashley 
I was just kidding!
I was just getting a little crazy with ideas.
-speak Matt 
I like it.
However, as it heads over the wall, you see it does not find purchase on the duergar.
It instead finds purchase on part of the wall.
-speak Ashley 
Fuck.
-speak Travis 
Poisoning the wall effectively.
-speak Matt 
Yes, it is now a poisoned property.
-speak Ashley 
Poisoning that wall.
Effectively!
Gosh dang it. That would have been cool.
-speak Matt 
That brings us to the top of the round.
Scanlan.
-speak Sam 
We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right?
-speak Liam 
Yes, he's going to run and tell people.
-speak Sam 
I've got almost nothing.
Can I summon an Unseen Servant to push him?
I don't have any ranged weapons.
-speak Matt 
Roll an athletics check for the Unseen Servant.
-speak Sam 
5!
-speak Matt 
You hear a ting sound as the duergar's armor is given a hefty slap.
-speak Scanlan 
Thank you, Jarvis!
-speak Sam 
And I'm going to just give a little inspiration to Vax.
That's Laura, obviously.
-speak Laura 
Yes, thank you.
-speak Matt 
All right, a d8 inspiration die to you as Scanlan hums a little tune under his breath.
Vex, you're up.
-speak Laura 
Oh! I attack him.
Natural 1!
-speak Marisha 
Damn it!
What is wrong with us?
-speak Travis 
What in the hot and holy shit is happening right now?
-speak Ashley 
What are we doing?
-speak Laura 
My second attack, though, is a 25.
-speak Matt 
So the first one you pull back, and as you pull back the actual arrow snaps.
-speak Vax 
You almost shot me!
-speak Vex 
Ow, that hurt my arm so bad.
-speak Laura 
8 damage.
-speak Matt 
Your second arrow manages to find its mark.
As it sticks pretty close to where he was shot from Bad News.
The duergar shrugs it off angrily, and aims his crossbow onto you.
A 17 will miss.
You manage to just dodge out of the way.
You hear it whiz past your ear.
That brings us to Percy.
-speak Taliesin 
I'll take one more shot at him.
-speak Liam 
Redemption, Percy.
-speak Travis 
Come on, buddy.
-speak Sam 
Kill this guy.
-speak Ashley 
Get it.
-speak Sam 
He's lasted longer than most of the people we fight.
-speak Taliesin 
18 to hit for 25 damage.
-speak Travis 
Thank you!
-speak Laura 
Yes!
-speak Matt 
You pull out one of your custom made, nasty looking bullets, load it back into Bad News.
You pull it back, aim up, and fire.
And once again, you guys are seeing this weapon up close.
With each shot, it takes all of his strength to not get blown off his feet.
-speak Vex 
That's badass, Percy.
-speak Matt 
A plume of white smoke comes shooting out the side of the weapon.
Its incredibly loud.
But the duergar's head is gone, with a thick red splatter against the wall behind him.
-speak Pike 
I love Bad News.
-speak Percy 
Let's move quickly.
-speak Vex 
Let's get in the door.
-speak Scanlan 
I think they heard us.
-speak Taliesin 
Going in the door.
-speak Laura 
We all go in the door.
-speak Matt 
All of you have made your way into the doorway.
-speak Laura 
Can Trinket fit?
-speak Matt 
Trinket can fit with you, yes.
-speak Liam 
Just barely.
-speak Ashley 
Just bear-ly.
-speak Laura 
If Grog can fit, Trinket can fit.
-speak Matt 
You guys make your way into this tiny little room.

-speak Everyone  
Whoa!
-speak Matt 
You're all very crammed in.
-speak Laura 
Into this teeny-tiny little room.
-speak Matt 
And we're going to take our break here!
-narrate 
The cast take the break, and then rejoin.
-speak Matt 
So you guys are in this storage room.
It's very musty.
It hasn't seen use in quite a while.
Alittle bit of mold is growing on the side of one of the barrels in the corner.
There is a doorway that is closed on the opposite side of this wall, and from what you can see, there is a stairway that curves upwards to the second floor.
-speak Vex 
I think we should go through the door, instead of going up.
-speak Vax 
I agree.
-speak Vex 
Because any prisoners are probably going to be kept at a low level.
-speak Vex 
Check for traps!
-speak Liam 
Yes, I'm going to sniff the door a bit.
Yeah, that's a 20.
-speak Matt 
The door is locked, but is not trapped.
-speak Liam 
Thieves' tools out.
Oh, that's an easy 30.
-speak Sam 
Jesus.
-speak Marisha 
God damn.
-speak Matt 
Which is good because it's a very, very intricate lock.
There is a specific key, a single key that is designed for this lock, that you gather is probably held by King Murghol himself.
You manage to get the right sequence, and with a slight click, the door opens slightly.

As you peek through this doorway, you can get a general idea of what looks to be some sort of an empty storage room.
A lot of materials have been moved out of it.
It looks like the remnants of stone, things that were used for construction that once were in this room that have been pulled out to build things.
Possibly moved as part of the war camp to start building some of the siege weapons that you saw above.
-speak Liam 
Do I hear anything?
-speak Matt 
Roll a perception check.
-speak Liam 
27.
-speak Matt 
You hear footsteps above.
Apparently there is some level of alert on the second floor.
-speak Laura 
Oh, shit. We should move fast.
-speak Marisha 
Hmm. I wonder why.
-speak Liam 
Go figure.
-speak Laura 
We should get out of the room.

There are two duergar stationed at two doors.
You can hear, every now and then, sounds like a moan or a slight whispering gurgle.

Hey, shut up in there!
-speak Liam 
Yeah, I'm going to go kill this guy.
-speak Laura 
You don't want to tell us what you found?

It's okay.
Let him do it by himself.
It's what he does best.

Dribbling deep crimson blood from his mouth.
But he still sees you both in the hallway and reaches for his warhammer.
Roll for initiative!
-speak Sam 
I turn to Pike and say:
-speak Scanlan 
What the fuck is going on?
Where are they?
-speak Pike 
Let's head down there.

I'm going to head down there.
-speak Matt 
So the rest of you are heading down there?

One of the dwarves is just wheezing in pain.
You can see his stomach is a little distended.
The other one is either unconscious, asleep, or dead.

And with a yell, slams it right into his face, causing his head to explode against the back of the wall.
Slams it again and again and again, and is just making hamburger of his entire body.
The arm sloughs off and she's just going nuts.
You can see her bludgeoning over and over again with a spray of gore on her.
There's this look of anger, frustrationâ€“
-speak Laura 
She's raging.
-speak Matt 
And a sick sense of joy in how she's just tearing this dwarf apart.
Eventually, after this frenzy, she takes a moment.
There is very little left recognizable of what once was a duergar.
-speak Sam 
I notice a bulge in Grog's pants.
-speak Pike 
I'm sorry I questioned you.
-speak Matt 
As she begins to hand it back to you, there's a slight flash of radiant energy that emanates from her hand.
And it burns all of the blood off the mace, and then she hands it back to you.
-speak Kima  
Thank you.
I needed that.
-speak Pike 
You're very welcome.
I'm sorry I questioned you.
-speak Grog 
That was amazing.
Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe?
-speak Kima  
If you want to part with it, certainly.
-speak Grog 
Oh, uh.
Maybe we should get out of here.
-speak Percy 
Why don't we collect your things?
-speak Vex 
Yeah, where are they?
Do you know?
-speak Percy 
I would assume they're being stored upstairs.
-speak Kima  
I have no idea.
They're either in the vault or they're in the armory.
-speak Scanlan 
Vault or the armory?
Those are places that we can go?
-speak Vex 
There's a vault?
-speak Kima  
As far as I can tell, myâ€“
-speak Vax 
Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary?
We know a secret entrance to this place.
We could leave now.
Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost?, 
-speak Kima  
They are divine implements, gifted to me from an avatar of Bahamut directly.
I feel, to leave them behind would be a partial failure to my quest.
Not to mention, with what we may face beyond this, we'll need every bit of help we can get.
-speak Grog 
Oh, shit.
-speak Vax 
Well, that's that then.
-speak Vex 
Let's find the frigging vault!
-speak Percy 
Let's go upstairs.
-speak Matt 
She leaps off the table.
-speak Kima  
So. Shall we?
-speak Scanlan 
Do you know where the vault is?
-speak Kima  
I can show you.
-speak Scanlan 
Lead the way!
-speak Marisha 
I go up to her, still in my Minxy form, and I rub on her legs.
-speak Taliesin 
Have you dropped the body yet?
-speak Travis 
I get right up behind them too, competing for space.
-speak Taliesin 
Are you dragging a dead body around?
-speak Marisha 
No, I dropped the body.
While she was talking, I took the body, and I drug it back, and I buried my shame.
-speak Matt 
Your shame has been sufficiently buried.
She doesn't look at you, but she pats you absentmindedly as she passes you, her direct intent on heading back up those stairs herself.
-speak Laura 
All right.
-speak Sam 
Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?
-speak Laura 
Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out, and maybe give them some food to try to help them out, if we can.
-speak Grog 
In the meantime, I have a greatsword or a morningstar mace that you can have.
-speak Kima  
Greatsword.
-speak Grog 
Greatsword it is.
-speak Matt 
She takes it from you, and the sword is a little over a foot taller than she is.
Maybe a little more than that.
-speak Laura 
She's really fricking buff.
-speak Liam 
She's a ripped halfling.
-speak Laura 
That's pretty badass.
-speak Matt 
She is a built halfling female.
She has seen some war, and she has survived some shit.
-speak Liam 
She's the Tyler Durden of halflings.
-speak Matt 
Kind of, yeah.
-speak Grog 
Would you care for some ale?
-speak Kima  
Later.
We have nothing to celebrate for yet.
-speak Grog 
Absolutely.
Plenty of time!
-speak Vax 
I think Grog is smitten!
-speak Vex 
She comes to your knee.
-speak Vax 
Oh my goodness!

-speak Laura 
Can I run in the little prison, and tell the dwarves:
-speak Vex 
Don't exit from where you came.
There's a secret entrance up and in a store room.
Go that way, and stealth out.
-speak Matt 
One of the ones that was semi-conscious, sits up and looks back at you:
-speak Dwarf  
Thank ye.
Thank ye kindly.
-speak Vex 
Here's some cheese!
-speak Matt 
He takes it hungrily through the bars and just starts eating it, incessantly, as you leave.
-speak Percy 
Government cheese.
-speak Vax 
Is provolone all you've got?
-speak Laura 
It's Velveeta.
-speak Matt 
Ugh, Velveeta!
-speak Marisha 
It's calories!

-speak Matt 
Kima moves into the hallway, and you notice she suddenly freees.
Staring up at the top of the stairway.
At Clarota.
-narrate 
Laura gasps.
-speak Vex 
Wait- Wait!
-speak Kima  
Who is this filthyâ€“
-speak Percy 
No no no no!
-speak Vex  
The mind flayer is with us!
He's our ally.
No one needs to fight.
His name is Clarota.
-speak Percy 
He's been an enormous help.
-speak Matt 
Without taking her eyes off of Clarotaâ€“
-speak Kima  
Are you to tell me that you've come down here and allied yourself with an entity that is the anathema of the Mountain?
-speak Grog 
Uh, what was that word?
-speak Vax 
We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far.
-speak Kima  
And for what purpose?
You think they don't have plots lined out for weeks and months?
There is no trust to be had with these creatures.
-speak Vax 
He has been shit out by these creatures.
They do not want him or trust him.
He is an outcast.
And we are working together, in this moment, and without him we would not have gotten here.
-speak Laura 
We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye.
-speak Kima  
And with him you will never get out.
Have you not thought for a second that perhaps all of you are being manipulated by this creature?
-speak Pike 
Well, I have.
-setbattle CR_C1_E6/8 11 15
-updatebattle
-speak Matt 
You can see the greatsword now flares with divine energy and she goes:
-speak Kima  
I will not stand here and let us ally ourselves with this filth!
-speak Matt 
You can see the her eyes change to an extremely bright, burning, silver light.
-speak Laura 
Oh my god, she's so cool!
-speak Kima  
Listen. You come with me. Without this creature!
Or you continue with it, and without me.
I will not walk beside this.
I have had its people devour mine since I set foot in here.
This creature, whatever its reasoning is, is not in your best interest.
It will lead you into a web of your own destruction! I've seen their kind work.
-speak Liam 
Clarota! Speak your mind!
Convince her. Fix this.
-speak Matt 
You can see Clarota's tendrils curl back in a sneer.
-speak Clarota  
Listen. I am not going to walk where I am not welcome.
I will not wake up with this woman's blade in my back!
-speak Liam 
Giving us a Walking Dead decision.
-speak Clarota  
We made a deal.
-movetoken vax 0 1

-speak Liam 
I walk between them and put my hands out.
-speak Vax 
We all want the same thing.
Kima. Tell us.
What is it that you've come here for? What is your purpose here?
Speak your mind, if you are true.
-speak Matt 
Kima turns back towards you, the same glowing flare in her eyes.
-speak Kima  
I've come here to rid this mountain, this continent, of the darkness deep within the bowels of this thing's city!
-speak Vax 
Clarota, why have you come here.
What is it you seek?
-speak Clarota  
Ah, I've come to destroy this creature K'Varn and free my people.
-speak Vax 
Then the two of you.
Get over your fucking shit.
We want the same thing here. Get over yourselves.
Both of you.
We share a common purpose.
We are going to end this fucking bullshit.
Kima, we have come here for you.
Pay us the respect that we have earned.
We have come a long way for you.
He is an unlikely ally, but he has gotten us to this point.
And together, for this moment and this moment only, we can work together.
We don't have to be school chums or buddies in a week from now.
But right now, right here, we will work together and achieve the same thing.
What say you, Kima? 
-speak Kima  
Free his people, he says.
What do you think will happen once his people are free?
Shall they let us walk out on our own?
-speak Percy 
He has given us his word. 
-speak Kima  
You know so very little of these dark caverns, my friend.
I watched these entities steal the very essence of those I travelled with.
I watched them capture them, and devour their very minds before me.
Laughing and cackling as I fled into the shadows.
-speak Vex 
But they were under control of K'Varn at that point.
-speak Kima  
Understand, whether or not K'Varn controls them to give them direction, this is what they are.
They do not hope society will thrive.
They do not want us free peoples to walk the surface.
They want us for food.
-speak Scanlan 
Lady Kima, if I may.
If you're intending us to choose between you, and our ally Clarota, and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us, then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but to choose our own friend Clarota over you.
-speak Vex 
What!?
-speak Scanlan 
We're giving you one last chance.
Either you are with us, or you are against us.
This is a threat.
-speak Kima  
So you walk in here, save me from my binds, under the words of my dear, lifelong friend Arcanist Alluraâ€“
-speak Scanlan 
We mean you no ill will.
It is you who are aggravating the situation.
-speak Vax 
You could be sitting in a cell by yourself doing fuck-all, or ending this problem now.
-speak Matt 
Make a persuasion check.
-speak Laura 
I'm so nervous!
Oh, Scanlan, come on!
-speak Sam 
Well, I rolled a 3.
-speak Liam 
I rolled a 13.
-speak Sam 
But I have a plus 13!
So that's a 16.
-speak Matt 
She takes a moment and steps forward.
She's a few inches taller than you.
-speak Sam 
Of course she is! Everyone is!
-speak Kima  
He of the pretty voice.
I am grateful that all of you have come and traversed all this danger in my name, to free me from the binds that have held me.
And I do wish, very much, to walk alongside you to this end.
And I understand, it may be very well possible that this thing has taken your minds without your knowledge.
Howeverâ€“

-speak Matt 
And her eyes close for a second, and she opens them again, and that radiant spark of silver fades, and her normal eye color returns.
-speak Kima  
We see ourselves with little choices.
And I have very little allies at this point to achieve my goal.
-speak Vex 
Oh, thank god.
-speak Kima  
If we are to travel together, this one must walk in step the entire time.
One single misstep, and I will not hesitate to carve that head from your body in the name of Bahamut.
-speak Grog 
I will help you do that if he missteps.
-speak Matt 
Clarota, hands still crossed, takes a step down the stairs towards her.
Its tendrils shift a little.
-speak Clarota  
And please, understand, if you ever intend to try and cut my life short, I will also not hesitate to bore that beautiful mind from your skull.
-speak Vax 
Once we murder this K'Varn, you guys are going to laugh so hard.
-speak Scanlan 
So friends then?
-speak Grog 
Allies, allies.
-speak Vax 
The enemy of my enemyâ€¦
-speak Scanlan 
Has mind-sucking tentacles.
-speak Kima  
I pray that you are right.
I pray that you're honest.
And I pray that through some strange will of the gods, this entity is telling the truth.
Because if it's not, none of us will make it out of here alive.
-speak Vax 
We're playing a game of chess here, Kima, and we will win.
-speak Laura 
I whisper in her ear: 
-speak Vex 
I would have chosen you.
-speak Sam 
I start humming 'Kumbaya'.

And that's where we'll end the game for this evening.
-speak Marisha 
What? No.
What time is it?
I thought we just got started?
-speak Travis 
I thought we were going to have to pick.
We got like ten more minutes!
-speak Marisha 
Yeah, we have ten more minutes.
-speak Sam 
No, no, no.
That's fine, that's fine.
-speak Laura 
No, yeah, that is a good place, or we're going to get in a battle.
-speak Matt 
Depending on where you guys are going next it could be a bit of a lengthy encounter, soâ€¦
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
-speak Liam 
So the building is empty.
-speak Matt 
It's totally empty!
-speak Laura 
Completely empty.
-speak Matt 
There's nobody in there.
No one has any idea that you're here.
-speak Travis 
Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick between one or the other, who's picking Kima?
-narrate 
Travis, Ashley and Laura put up their hands.
-speak Travis 
Who's picking turtle-face?

Sam and Marisha raise their hands.
-speak Liam 
I don't know.
-speak Travis 
We're going to throw down, this is gonna be Marvel versus DC in this bitch.
-speak Laura 
She's Allura's friend, she's good!
-speak Liam 
Undecided, I don't know.
-speak Laura 
Would you pick Kima?
-speak Travis 
Yeah!
-speak Sam 
You just want her because she's badass and you could hump her.
-speak Travis 
Yeah!
-speak Matt 
Oh, Grog.
-speak Laura 
That would be the most awkward humping ever.
-speak Travis 
Did you see her work in that room of blood?
-speak Taliesin 
Only one of them is demanding that I become a liar.
-speak Ashley 
Wait, dang it!
I wanted to take some torture weapons!
-speak Matt  
You can go back if you want to.
-speak Ashley 
Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes and go get some torture weapons?
-speak Liam 
What's it for?!
-speak Matt  
This would be pretty quick, you have to grab some things as everyone is heading up the stairs.
-speak Liam 
Who's your deity?
Harvey Keitel?
-speak Ashley 
No! Just for Grog!
-speak Matt  
Pike, the war priest, who has been guided by light of Sarenrae.
Once a gnome of light and joy, who went to the edge of death and returned. 
Who went to sea, traveled with rough and tumble folks.
Has returned now with her mind bent on war, vengeance.
-speak Travis 
Yeah!
-speak Matt  
And what it means to win a battle.
Through force if necessary.
You gather up what appear to be two large, bladed hooks, a lengthy hand-razor.
-speak Marisha 
You're going to go Sweeney Todd all up in this shit.
-speak Liam 
A Milli Vanilli album, andâ€¦
-speak Matt  
A small bag of various instruments that are rusty and nasty.
-speak Laura 
Ew.
-speak Matt  
It's all you have time to grab before you have to bolt back up to get to the rest.
And we'll pick up the next game, as you guys head up the stairs back into the hallway.
In the center of the Emberhold duergar stronghold, Lady Kima released and a very tentative alliance.
So, thank you guys all for watching!
-speak Marisha 
Pain in the ass, Lady Kima.
Pain in my ass.
