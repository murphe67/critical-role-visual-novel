-speak Matt 
Hello everyone, welcome to the fifth episode of Critical Role!
As a heads-up, unfortunately we're going to be down one Scanlan due to work.
The bard will be in our hearts this evening, and you're welcome to tweet at him angrily to make sure he makes the next session.
You guys have just finished a heavy, blood-filled battle.
With Percy getting his hand caught and firing his gun into the gullet of a bulette.
But eventually it had its armor pulled apart and was defeated by the party.
The remnants of the duergar army inside of this building have been destroyed, aside from a few stragglers who have laid their weapons down.
And the general now lies beaten, on his knees before the rest of the party.
And that is where we pick up and begin.
The general's on the ground, warhammer at his side.
Blackened armor still sizzling from his Banishment.
He has a gnarled, brackish beard, and these wild white-coated eyes.
-speak General  
So you found your way in.
What's your purpose? What do you want from me?
-speak Liam 
Vax walks right up to him, grabs him by the hair, and puts a dagger to his throat.
-speak Vax 
Let's have a talk. 
Would you like to have a chat?
-speak Vex 
Of course I would, thank you.
-speak General  
If you want blood, take it.
It's all you're getting from me.
-speak Grog 
Okay, kill him.
-speak Vex 
We don't want your blood.
We're looking for a halfling. Have you seen one?
-speak General  
I don't know what you're talking about.
-speak Vex 
A female halfling.
She came down here.
-speak General  
Well, she wouldn't have gotten far if she did.
Not with my people.
-speak Liam 
I stick my dagger in, just slightly.
-speak Vax 
Your master is gone.
It's just you and my friends here now, I think it's in your best interest to talk.
You could walk away from here.
You don't have to die.
If you can play nicely.
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make an intimidation roll with advantage.
-speak Travis 
First roll of the night.
-speak Liam 
Natural 20!
-speak Matt 
That's a way to start.
-speak Marisha 
The first one tonight!
-speak Laura 
That's the way!
-speak Matt 
As you pull the blade to his throat, he chuckles deeply against the strain.
-speak General  
Your halfling lass was foolish.
We took her.
We delivered her to King Murghol as a present.
If she lives, she's probably ruined and broken deep within the dungeons of Emberhold.
You're welcome to go for her there.
-speak Marisha 
Can I do an insight check to see if he's lying about that?
-speak Matt 
Go for it.
-speak Percy 
I think we have some prisoners to free or something as well.
-speak Vex 
Yes.
-speak Marisha 
22.
-speak Matt 
He does not appear to be lying about his interpretation of her, he'll telling you where he last saw her.
As to where her current state is, you don't know.
But he seems to have a strong belief about whether she'd still be alive.
-speak Keyleth 
What about a secret path?
So we can avoid some of these people?
-speak Laura 
Can I start speaking to him in Underdark?
-speak Matt 
Of course.
-speak Marisha 
That's hot.
-speak Vex 
Tell me about the hidden passages.
I know there are some.
-speak Travis 
What does Underdark sound like, by the way?
-speak Laura 
It sounds kind of like–
-speak Taliesin 
Parseltongue?
-speak Liam 
It's like Pig Latin.
-narrate 
Laura makes strange whispery noises.
-speak Travis 
Mm, no!
-speak Liam 
Ere-way are the idden-hay assages-pay?
-speak Matt 
It's kind of reminiscent of Black Speech from the Tolkien universe, that guttural-
-narrate 
Matt imitates the Black Speech from The Lord of the Rings.
-continue  
Very deep.
-speak Laura 
Oh right, that.
-speak Matt 
With a whispering darkness to it.
As she speaks this tongue, it catches a lot of you off guard, you've not heard her use this before.
Make an intimidation check.
-speak Pike 
Vex, what are you doing?
What is this coming out of your mouth?
-speak Grog 
That sounds real pretty.
-speak Laura 
18.
-speak General  
No passages to the stronghold, but there is a way in.
Aside from the front.
Good luck even getting there.
-speak Pike 
Is it through the lake?
-speak General  
Yes, through the lake.
Deep below, you'll find a tunnel.
This tunnel will lead you to a subterranean passage straight to the stronghold.
-speak Laura 
Can we check to make sure he's not untruthful?
-speak Matt 
Make an insight check.
-speak Laura 
16?
-speak Matt 
No, he's bullshitting through his teeth.
Hey, he seemed honest about the passage into the stronghold.
But dishonest about the lake, he's basically following her lead.
-speak Vex 
You're lying.
-speak General  
Perhaps.
-speak Vex 
Tell us true, where is it?
-speak General  
If I tell you, will you let me live?
-speak Grog 
Ooh. Well.
-speak Percy 
I think that's very reasonable.
-speak Vex 
I think that's reasonable.
-speak General  
I'm essentially–
-speak Percy 
We will not kill you.
-speak Vex 
I think we can–
-speak Grog 
We can lock him up.
And then kill him.
-speak Vax 
We'll leave you alive.
-speak General  
Don't just leave me alive.
Give me a chance to walk from this building, on my own, arms intact.
-speak Grog 
No.
-speak General  
And I'll give you the secret entrance to Emberhold itself, leading you straight within the throne room.
-speak Travis 
I go over and pick up his warhammer.
-speak Grog 
You may leave. Maybe.
But I get to keep this as a souvenir.
-speak Percy 
I actually think this is an appropriate moment to play with a bit of banditry.
I say we take everything from him and he can make his way out all on his own.
-speak Grog 
I like that idea.
-speak Keyleth 
Ooh, that's fun.
-speak Grog 
Butt naked.
-speak Keyleth 
Why don't we take him with us?
Just in casies–
-speak Matt 
At which point, a cold, clammy hand touches your shoulder and pulls you aside.
-speak Marisha 
Ew.
-speak Matt 
A partially hooded Clarota steps forward.
-speak Clarota  
I'll attempt to read his surface thoughts.
If he tries to keep it from me, I'll know.
-speak Matt 
As he steps forward, he puts one hand in front of him and his eyes gleam with a sickly green hue.
You can see the general tips his head back and begins twitching an eye.
Sweat begins to bead around his brow as Clarota takes another step forward.
-speak General  
Let me live.
Let me go and I'll tell you.
This isn't necessary.
I'm willing to give you the information.
-speak Matt 
You can see a trickle of blood begin to pour out of one of his nostrils.
-speak Laura 
What do we do?
I think we should stop him. Should we stop him?
-speak Vax 
Clarota.
-speak Vex 
Wait.
-speak Vax 
Does he know anything about K'varn?
-speak Clarota  
Let me see.
-speak Matt 
And the mind flayer pushes once more into the general brain.
You see a twitch to the general's face, trying to resist.
But his will has been broken by losing the battle, and by Clarota's sheer intensity.
The blood starts to stream from his ears as well.
-speak Clarota  
He has not seen K'varn, but knows a bit of his nature.
I cannot read it, but we could press for more information.
-speak Vex 
I think we should just ask him.
-speak Vax 
Our friend here is not as patient as I am.
We want to know about this K'varn.
And we want you and all your men, all your little mates here, to throw your weapons into the chasm.
You can go fuck off, but we want to know everything.
And this is your last chance.
Right now, right here. Talk.
-speak Grog 
And you have to get naked.
-speak Vex 
And you have to get naked.
-speak Vax 
That's correct.
-speak Percy 
I'm with you on that.
-speak Grog 
Thank you.
-speak Pike 
Yeah, me too.
-speak Keyleth 
It's starting to become a thing now.
I'm just saying.
-speak General  
K'varn was responsible for forging the alliance.
For centuries and generations, the mind flayers and my people killed and fought.
It wasn't until K'varn came that we decided to work together for a common cause.
Expansion, unification, dominion over this land and these mountains.
Divided, we were weak, petty, greedy.
With K'varn leading us, we have purpose, we have growth.
We could take what we'd like, and I'm but one dwarf.
If I fall here, many more will rise.
-speak Percy 
Well, we can see that's obviously worked out really well for you.
I think that I'm satisfied, are you satisfied?
-speak Vex 
What kind of creature is K'varn?
-speak Vax 
What is K'varn?
-speak General  
I have not seen K'varn personally.
-speak Vex 
But you've heard rumors, though?
-speak General  
What I know of K'varn– a being of immense intelligence.
A creature that needs not walk this earth, does not touch the land that it traverses.
I know it sees all, it smiles from a toothy maw.
And laughs in the darkness.
Protruding from its forehead, one nasty, gnarled black horn, terrible source of its dark power.
That is what's beneath here.
-speak Laura 
Is he telling the truth?
-speak Matt 
Insight check.
-speak Taliesin 
Would I recognize this creature he's describing?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a nature check. Or arcana, either one.
-speak Taliesin 
14 arcana.
-speak Marisha 
29, nature.
-speak Matt 
No natural creature you've ever heard has this type of essence to it, having a single black horn.
-speak Liam 
It's clearly a narwhal.
It's a sentient narwhal.
-speak Matt 
It's an awful, awful narwhal.
Way to spoil the story, Liam.
-speak Marisha 
Demon narwhal.
-speak Matt 
Gnashing teeth, black horn, very intelligent?
That doesn't seem to be anything from nature itself.
You know a few entities, but usually there are multiple horns.
Demonic beings would have extreme intelligence, sharp teeth, horns.
You've had brushes in the past with demons, but nothing in particular is coming to mind.
-speak Vex 
Maybe we should let him go.
-speak Vax 
Why don't you strip?
-speak Grog 
Do you wanna handcuff him?
-speak Pike 
Take off your clothes!
-speak Laura 
We take Grog's handcuffs out of his bag.
-speak General  
That was not the deal!
You leave me, unspoiled, on my life, and I tell you the way into Emberhold.
-speak Vex 
Well, tell us!
You haven't told us yet, have you?
-speak Vax 
We already told you your weapons are ours.
-speak Percy 
In fact, we'll be keeping your weapons, your armor, and I believe, your pride.
-speak Vex 
But your life is yours.
-speak Percy 
You may even outrun the dwarves we're about to set free.
-speak Grog 
Percy's fucked-up tonight, I like it.
-speak Percy 
I'm in a mood.
-speak General  
Emberhold.
-speak Vax 
He tried to make a book out of someone's flesh once.
-speak Vex 
Wait, wait, he's telling us, shut up.
-speak General  
Emberhold is the fortress of our people, built to resist assault from all sides.
We've an army, hiding about the outskirts of it.
Your best bet is on the left side of the fortress.
There are two streams of molten rock that pour down the side.
The smaller of those two streams covers a secret tunnel.
It's meant to open from the inside.
A trapdoor-like mechanism that splits the flow to make an archway.
From the outside, well, good luck.
I've done my side of the bargain. Let me free.
-speak Vex 
You're free to go.
Not toward your stronghold, but towards the surface.
-speak Grog 
Can't we have Scanlan turn him into a porpoise?
-speak Matt   
He picks up his warhammer.
-speak Grog 
I don't think so. No, that's mine.
As a token to remember you by.
-speak General  
Unspoiled was the deal.
-speak Vax 
Wasn't the deal.
-speak Grog 
No, it's great.
You can really argue all you want to, or I'll just smash your fucking head in.
-speak Vax 
We said you were alive, your weapons were ours.
What, have you got shit in your ears?
-speak Matt 
Takes a couple of steps forward towards you, holding the warhammer out.
-speak Vax 
Your skull is unspoiled.
-hide duergar_general
-speak Matt 
Suddenly, he turns completely invisible, vanishes from sight.
-speak Laura 
My perception's really high, can I try to find him?
-speak Liam 
Yeah, we can. Perception check.
-speak Travis 
You dicks.
-speak Matt 
You hear his footsteps.
-speak Liam 
Perception check.
-speak Laura 
Wait, no! Mother bitch.
-speak Liam 
18 for me.
-speak Marisha 
Just let him go, it's all he's got.
-speak Ashley 
We should throw something.
-speak Travis 
I want the hammer!
-show duergar_general 3
-speak Matt 
At this point, he becomes visible again, about 20 feet out, gone down the stairs and towards the front door and he just–
-speak Liam 
I'm throwing a dagger at him.
-speak Keyleth 
Oh, look.
-speak Travis 
And I'm throwing my ax at him with the chain of returning as well.
-speak Liam 
28 to hit for 10 damage.
-speak Travis 
17 for 15 damage.
-speak Matt 
As the dagger and the axe both make contact, the general suddenly freezes in place, as Clarota stretches out a hand.
A significant amount of blood beginning to pool around his feet.
Clarota steps in front of him, and his tendrils slowly wrap around his head.
-hide duergar_general
-continue 
You can see them meet at the back of his skull, and with this horrible crunching sound, you see his head shudder, as his limbs go limp.
-speak Liam 
~I'm lovin' it.~
-speak Matt 
This horrible slurping sound continues for a few moments.
-speak Laura 
Oh no.
-speak Matt 
And then you hear this dull, sickening, hollow sucking sound.
The tentacles release, and the captain falls onto his back.
A giant bloodied hole in the center of his skull.
-speak Pike 
He ate his brain?
-speak Grog 
I guess you should've left the hammer, shouldn't you?
-speak Percy 
Some people are terrible losers, just really terrible.
-speak Travis 
I would like to pick up the hammer.
-speak Keyleth 
This is a good lesson, to no one else that's watching.
-speak Pike 
Clarota, I am a fan.
-speak Keyleth 
No one is watching this valuable lesson.
-speak Percy 
Do not be an oathbreaker.
-speak Keyleth 
To not be an oathbreaker!
-speak Percy 
Know when you've lost your clothes.
-speak Vex 
Was that actually, like, a meal for you?
-speak Matt 
As you're looking, you can see there's some purplish crimson around Clarota's tendrils.
He wipes it off with his hands.
-speak Clarota  
It's enough to sustain me a while.
I was getting hungry.
-speak Vex 
Well. Better him than us, I say.
-speak Grog 
Right. Me, I'm just an appetizer.
-speak Laura 
Loot the body!
-speak Matt 
Yes, so you loot the body.
Amongst all the duergar bodies here, you're looking at somewhere in the neighbourhood of about five to six hundred gold pieces.
You'll have to check later.
-speak Laura 
Ooh! I write that down.
-speak Matt 
A series of weapons.
None of them seem to have any sort of magical value.
The general's blackened plate armor does radiate a magical essence, as does the warhammer he was holding.
-speak Laura 
We should take that, and then also the other sets, and put it in the bag of holding, so we can sneak in if we want to.
How many sets were there?
-speak Matt 
From what is in here, that would be 11 sets, total.
But only the general's is enchanted.
-speak Laura 
Nice!
-speak Marisha 
Is Grog about to get a new weapon?
-speak Taliesin 
Laura, you got a grapple arrow, last I gave you, by the way.
Yeah, you fire it and it prones somebody.
-speak Laura 
Seriously? That's so cool, thank you!
-speak Taliesin 
I'm gonna Hawkeye you out at some point.
-speak Laura 
Oh my gosh.
-speak Travis 
Can we do a magical check on the-
-speak Matt 
I will say that Scanlan is able to ascertain the nature of both the hammer and the plate armor.
-narrate 
Matt hands the stat block descriptions to Travis.
-speak Laura 
What is it? What was it?
-speak Liam 
There's not any kind of dark magic about the armor, is there?
-speak Pike 
Clarota, so when you eat their brains, do you also get their thoughts, maybe?
-speak Travis 
Ooh! The heavy plate armor has resistance to fire damage.
-speak Clarota  
There are residual memories, thoughts.
It's delicious.
-speak Travis 
Clarota is Dracula.
-speak Clarota  
But there's a relishing in the moment-
-speak Keyleth 
Do we need to give you a moment alone?
We can leave.
-speak Clarota  
He speaks the truth about the path into the Emberhold.
-speak Vex 
All right.
-speak Vax 
So, he spoke of some sort of trap door that's easy to open from within, but not from outside, correct?
-speak Keyleth 
It was hidden by a lava flow.
-speak Laura 
Are there a lot of other soldiers still in the camp, or did we–
-speak Matt 
Oh, there are plenty of soldiers still in the camp.
You stealthed into the barracks.
-speak Laura 
Oh shit!
We should've kept him alive, you guys!
-speak Liam 
Well, he was about to walk out the door and cause mayhem.
-speak Travis 
Can I harvest any natural armor from the bulette?
The kitty?
-speak Matt 
You can certainly try.
There's plates that have been broken and cracked.
You can try and start cleaving away at it.
-speak Travis 
All right, yes, I start butchering, or something, the bulette.
-speak Matt 
It's really tough hide.
It takes you a few minutes.
You manage to get, let's say, about three saucer-shaped pieces of armor out of it.
You could definitely get more, but then you start hearing bells going off.
-speak Vex 
Okay, we should all put on black armor. Does that matter?
-speak Vax 
We should just get out of here.
Keyleth, can you fucking eagle up and let's go.
-speak Matt 
You start hearing horns.
-speak Vex 
We need to free those dwarves.
-speak Vax 
Stealth, stealth. And get out.
Go stealth and get out.

-speak Marisha 
I cast Pass Without A Trace.

What are we doing?
-speak Liam 
We're going up.
Straight up.
-speak Laura 
Up and out.
Can we stealth, while we do it?
Where's Trinket?
-speak Taliesin 
Trinket's back on the other side.
-speak Matt 
Trinket didn't come with you to the battle, because there was nobody to get Trinket across.
-speak Laura 
Oh, he's just on the other side by himself, all lonely?
-speak Matt 
Yeah, I know.
You weren't here to protect your bear.
-speak Laura 
That's so terrible.
-speak Ashley 
He's safe over there?
-speak Matt 
Hopefully.
-speak Ashley 
Oh Trinket!
-speak Matt 
Everyone, make a stealth check.
With a +10 thanks to Keyleth's spell.
-speak Ashley 
Natural 20!
-speak Marisha 
18.
-speak Taliesin 
19.
-speak Travis 
19.
-speak Laura 
31 for me.
-speak Liam 
29.
-speak Matt 
All right, so you all take off.
Close to 30 or 40 duergar are rushing towards the barracks as you lift off. 
They scream, in Undercommon:
-speak Duergar 
There!
-speak Duergar 
Above, look!
-speak Vex 
Oh, they saw us.
-speak Pike 
Maybe you should scream, like, no, they went the other way!
-speak Vax 
Just keep going up, up, up.
-speak Matt 
A stream of javelins comes firing up in your direction.
-speak Laura 
How did they see us?
I thought we were stealthed.
-speak Matt 
However, for those that rolled less than 20 on stealth, each of you are getting three javelins each to you.
So that's Keyleth, Percy and Grog.
So three javelins against Keyleth, miss you entirely.
Actually, one more against you, Keyleth.
That one does hit.
You take 14 points of piercing damage as the javelin just scrapes off the side of your giant eagle torso.
-narrate 
Marisha screeches in pain as an eagle.
-continue 
Percy, that's a 21, an 18, and a 20.
So you take three javelins. 24 points of piercing damage.
Two strike you off the shoulders.
One actually embeds itself partway into your waist and you have to pull it out.
Dug a good six, seven inches in.
-speak Ashley 
What are you at?
-speak Taliesin 
I'm at 15.
-speak Ashley 
15!?
-speak Taliesin 
I was already really low.
-speak Laura 
We haven't healed him yet.
-speak Matt 
Natural 20 on Grog!
Second one misses.
Another natural 20.
Not even joking.
-speak Liam 
Double crits, oh.
Good thing you got a thousand hit points.
-speak Travis 
Uh oh.
-speak Liam 
That's the point of a meat tank.
-speak Matt 
You take a total of 36 points of piercing damage, Grog.
-speak Ashley 
And he still has more hitpoints than we do.
-speak Matt 
Yeah, probably.
-speak Marisha 
Ouchies.
-speak Matt 
Oh, barbarian.
-speak Liam 
If Scanlan were here, he'd moon them all.
-speak Laura 
He is here, technically.
-speak Taliesin 
Scanlan's peeing down.
-speak Matt 
You guys continue, cresting over the top.
You can now see more and more are starting to gather, the bells are going off, the horns are blowing hard.
You can see a bunch of them are now running over to what looks like some of this siege equipment they had constructed–
Which includes a few large ballistae.
-speak Liam 
I think we should dive bomb towards the far tunnel past this war camp.
-speak Laura 
No, but Trinket!
-speak Liam 
He's fine, he's hiding out.
They don't know he's here.
-speak Travis 
Leave him.
-speak Taliesin 
He'll be fine.
-speak Liam 
We're going to dive.
Yes, dive bomb, dive bomb!
-speak Taliesin 
The bear can take care of himself.
-speak Liam 
I take hold of the front of the carpet and steer it down towards the tunnel.
I'm steering the carpet.
-scene seta
-speak Laura 
We got to free those dwarves, y'all.
-speak Liam 
We don't have to. That seems complicated.
-scene not eagle
-speak Matt 
Another volley comes to the guys who were under-stealthed.
So, against Keyleth, one hits.
You take 12 points of piercing damage.
-hide gianteagle
-show keyleth -4
-refresh pike
-speak Marisha 
I am no longer an eagle.
-speak Taliesin 
Oh my God.
-speak Travis 
Oh shit, really?
-speak Matt 
Two javelins miss Percy.
Keyleth's eagle form drops.
You guys are about 80 feet up.
-speak Keyleth 
Help!
-speak Matt 
At which point, Grog goes into a free fall along with Keyleth.
-speak Laura 
We dive under them!
-speak Liam 
Dive, dive, dive, dive!
-speak Matt 
Vax, since you're steering this, go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
-speak Liam 
Okay.
-speak Marisha 
I don't know what to do.
-speak Laura 
Can we try to catch– 
Can we try to– 
What do I have?
-speak Liam 
25.
-speak Matt 
All right, so you swoop underneath.
-speak Ashley 
Fuck.
-speak Laura 
Can I use the rope of endless twine and try to lasso one of them?
-speak Matt 
You'd have to pull it out of the bag of holding and then turn into a lasso, that's gonna take you a full minute, so you don't have time.
-speak Liam 
I have a rope.
I let go of the front of the carpet, I put one end of the rope in my sister's hand, and I jump off towards Grog, holding it around in one hand as I go–
-speak Laura 
Oh god.
-speak Taliesin 
I grapple onto her to hold her down.
-speak Travis  
I'm so heavy.
-speak Laura 
Okay, then you should–
-speak Matt 
So here's what happens.
You've rushed underneath with the magic carpet, all of you barely managing to hold on.
As both Keyleth and Grog slam into it from above.
-speak Laura 
That's too many people on the carpet.
And Vax is dangling off of it now by a rope.
We're gonna die!
-speak Matt 
The carpet now has too much weight and is currently giving out.
You're coming down at a very, very fast pace at an angle over the barracks towards the back end of the war camp.
-speak Laura 
Oh shit.
-speak Marisha 
Can I cast Wind Wall right underneath of the carpet to kind of like airbend us up?
-speak Matt 
You can attempt to.
-speak Travis 
I begin to fart to slow the fall.
-speak Marisha 
Ahh!
-speak Liam 
How high are we at this second?
-speak Matt 
At this second, you're about 70 feet up.
-speak Marisha 
Ohh.
-speak Liam 
And the closest building, the highest building under us is how tall?
-speak Matt 
It's about 15 feet tall.
-speak Liam 
Ohh.
-speak Marisha 
And did the Wind Wall thing work?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and roll a concentration check.
-speak Marisha 
Fucking shit.
Not good. 7.
-speak Matt 
The spell fizzles.
-speak Liam 
How far are we from the tunnel that we were talking about?
-speak Matt 
From what you can see here, you're probably about 60 feet.
-speak Laura 
We're right over the camp, aren't we?
-speak Matt 
You're towards the back of it, thankfully.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm bracing to roll.
-speak Laura 
Yeah, we're all like bracing.
-speak Marisha 
Three-point landing!
-speak Liam 
We're gonna hit, we're gonna hit.
-speak Matt 
So you all brace for impact.
The actual carpet's careening out of control.
You can see there's just barely the top of a building you might be able to try and skim.
-speak Laura 
Can we jump onto the top of the building?
-speak Matt 
This is going to be up to the one who's been steering this whole time.
Go ahead and make an intelligence check.
-speak Laura 
Intelligence!
-speak Liam 
Intelligence?
-speak Matt 
Yes.
-speak Travis 
Thank God it's not me.
-speak Liam 
Good, good, good, good.
21.
-speak Matt 
You just managed to skim the edge, which lessens the impact slightly. 
However, it does send you all into a full end-over-end topple. 
Everyone.
Make an acrobatics check.
-speak Laura 
Oh, god. Which one to roll, which one to roll.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, no.
Ah, this is going terribly! I'm failing!
-speak Liam 
18.
-speak Laura 
Natural 1!
-speak Ashley 
13.
-speak Travis 
18.
-speak Taliesin 
23.
-speak Marisha 
4.
-speak Laura 
But I have a +9 acrobatics!
-speak Liam 
Doesn't matter.
-speak Taliesin 
This is going to knock me out.
-speak Matt 
Gonna roll some fall damage here.
18 points of damage to Percy and Vax.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm out.
-speak Marisha 
You're out again?
-speak Taliesin 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
He didn't have a lot of hit points left.
-speak Laura 
Oh no, we're all dead!
-speak Marisha 
This the second time Grog's almost fallen to his death.
-speak Matt 
The rest of you all take 36 points of fall damage.
You take 45 points of damage from the impact, Grog.
And leave a small crater.
-speak Travis 
Thank you.
-speak Marisha 
You know what, that could've been worse.
-speak Matt 
That knocks Scanlan unconscious.
-speak Laura 
Fuck.
-speak Matt 
So, you all tumble end over end, come to rest.
-speak Marisha 
We just crash-landed in a war camp.
-speak Matt 
Yeah. On the far end of it, thankfully.
-speak Marisha 
Oh boy.
-speak Matt 
You guys can hear the bells and the horns going in the distance.
It looks like all the rest of the folks that were stationed here moved towards the center.
You managed to arc over them, but they're going to be here shortly.
-speak Travis 
Are we near their big war machines?
-speak Matt 
No, the ballistae are on the opposite–
-speak Liam 
I'm pulling Pike up onto her feet and dragging her towards Scanlan, because I know how fucked up he was from the last battle.
-speak Pike 
Where's Scanlan? How close–
-speak Keyleth 
How, how–
-speak Pike 
Percy's out, let's go–
-speak Vax 
But so is Scanlan.
-speak Matt 
Percy's just face-down in the ground, scrapes across the side of his face.
You guys are about ten feet from each other, scattered from the impact.
As this is happening, Percy, go ahead and make a death saving throw.
-speak Laura 
Oh!
-scene set2
-speak Travis 
A death saving throw?
-speak Taliesin  
9.
-speak Matt 
That's a fail, so mark off one failed death save on your sheet.
-narrate 
Laura gasps.
-speak Ashley 
No no no no!
-speak Travis 
Oh shit!
-speak Matt 
Scanlan does make his.
-speak Ashley 
Mass Cure Wounds!
20 healing to up to 6 creatures.
So everyone except for me, 24 healing.
-speak Travis 
Ugh, that's huge.
-speak Laura 
Oh my god, it's major.
-speak Matt 
Percy and Scanlan come to consciousness.
-speak Vax 
We gotta keep moving.
-speak Liam 
I pull out a potion and slap it into Percy's hand.
-speak Keyleth 
Yeah, we gotta go.
-speak Liam 
And then grab him by the wrist and just start walking.
-speak Percy 
I'm up.
-speak Keyleth 
Here, wait.
-speak Marisha 
Save the potion, I cast Healing Word on Percy.
-speak Matt 
You guys run towards the back, towards the main tunnel, it's about 40 feet high and 30 feet wide across.
You go running through the buildings.
A few duergar kinda poke their heads out.
You hear the distant echoing shouts of more heading in your direction.
You hear a few ballista bolts hitting the wall above you.
You guys have now pushed into the tunnel.
-speak Marisha 
I cast Wall Of Stone. And seal the tunnel.
-speak Vex 
Are we running?
-speak Matt 
As you're doing this, you realizing there's one member of your party that you haven't had a lot of time with–
-speak Laura 
Clarota!
-speak Matt 
That you didn't think about until this moment.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, yeah!
-speak Matt 
You now see, floating, levitating, about 30 feet away, Clarota. 
Slowly descending towards you.
-speak Grog 
Come on Squidworth, over here!
-speak Matt 
Two bolts go firing towards him.
One whooshes overhead.
A second one pierces through his back, out the front of his chest.
-speak Keyleth 
Clarota!
-speak Vex 
No!
-speak Liam 
He's gotta have more than ten hit points.
-speak Matt 
The bolt itself is about four feet long, with a jagged tip.
Clarota begins to falter, slowly hovering towards you.
Almost, like, trying to swim through the air in your direction.
-speak Laura 
Can we run out, try to grab him?
-speak Matt 
He's about 20 feet from you now.
-speak Travis 
I take off and run to him.
-speak Matt 
Two more bolts come towards him.
Both pass overhead.
At this distance, in the darkness of the cavern, it's hard for them to get a bead on him.
Clarota hits the ground in front of you, and almost loses consciousness.
Grog, you manage to grab him, and help him into the tunnel.
-speak Marisha 
And now, Wall Of Stone.
-speak Matt 
Keyleth turns around, raising her hands.
-background black   
-continue 
The actual blackened stonework of this tunnel shakes for a second, and then a giant, thick wall of natural rock closes off the entire tunnel behind you.
-speak Vex 
I love you, Trinket!
-speak Vax 
Completely seals it?
-speak Keyleth 
Oh, gosh.
-scene set3
-speak Matt 
Completely seals it.
You guys are now in complete darkness.
You can hear javelins and ballistae bolts hitting the wall. 
But the wall's keeping them at bay.
-speak Travis 
Whatever we do from here, I sprinkle dust of tracelessness behind us the whole time like a fucking flower girl.
-speak Vax 
That wall won't hold forever. Let's move.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm going to give Clarota one of our potions.
-speak Laura 
Don't get too close, he might just suck in your brain.
-speak Matt 
You can certainly try.
-speak Keyleth 
Grog?
-speak Grog 
What?
-speak Keyleth 
Do you have any ale?
-speak Grog 
Yeah, I do have a cask, actually.
-speak Keyleth 
I think I need a drink.
-speak Grog 
Right. Here you go.
-speak Taliesin  
17 points of healing.
-speak Matt 
Administering a potion to a mind flayer is something that very few people experience.
As you kind of reach over, grab his shoulder, you look for where to put it.
At first the tendrils flail about, but as he notices what you're doing, kind of relax and open up.
And you can now see the circular, lamprey-like, toothy maw of the mind flayer.
It's a very disturbing, disgusting image, with these jagged, yellow teeth, in a circular form.
You pop the cork, and just pour it in.
As you do, you see the wounds across Clarota's form begin to heal.
The arrow is still stuck in its torso.
-speak Laura 
Can we try to pull it out?
-speak Matt 
You can certainly try.
-speak Grog 
I got it!
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a– this would be a medicine check.
-speak Vex 
Do you wanna do that, Grog?
-speak Grog 
I'll do the breaking part.
-speak Matt 
It's solid iron.
Breaking it off is not gonna work. You have to pull it from the wound.
-speak Pike 
I'll try.
-speak Ashley 
9?
-speak Laura 
Oh no.
-speak Ashley 
Sorry!
-speak Matt 
You take your moment, you look at the puncture wound.
With a little bit of Grog's help, you both grab the edge.
You count down from 3, and together you rip it right out.
In doing so, Clarota does take an additional eight points of damage.
-speak Pike 
I'm sorry!
-speak Matt 
But, the wound is now able to heal.
Clarota takes a moment and kind of grasps the wound.
At which point, you now hear impact sounds against the stone wall.
-speak Vex 
We should move!
-speak Pike 
Time to go!
-speak Vax 
Let's keep moving, yes?
-speak Travis 
I pick up Clarota and we start running balls.
-speak Liam 
Hold on a second.
I take out the flying carpet–
-speak Vax 
Here, sit on this, Clarota.
-speak Vex 
If you need it.
-speak Vax 
That'd be easier, yes?
-speak Matt 
Clarota gets up on the carpet.
-speak Clarota  
Thank you.
-scene set5
-speak Matt 
The carpet kind of drifts alongside you guys.
As you travel, the tunnel begins to pinch a little bit.
It gets to about a 15-foot width before it opens up again.
You  travel about a hundred feet.
Eventually, it opens up fully.
-background kraghammer
-continue 
Into what looks like an extension of the war camp.
-speak Vex 
We should've gone down!
What were we thinking?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make a perception check.
-speak Vax 
That guy was lying.
-speak Vex 
Well, he said go down.
We didn't go down.
-speak Liam 
21 for me.
-speak Matt 
Looking inside though, this camp looks like it's been abandoned.
-speak Laura 
Oh, good!
-speak Matt 
It looks like it was built, and then the war camp you just escaped from was the next step.
Like it's slowly advancing.
As you push in there's old campfires, some of the tents have partially collapsed.
Dust has gathered.
-speak Liam 
I'm keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit.
-speak Matt 
There isn't anything interesting.
Looks like they took everything of value when they moved.
It no longer serves a purpose and anything of use has been stripped and taken.
This ceiling of the cavern is maybe about 60 feet up or so.
And you can now see there are two exit tunnels to this section.
One that is kind of straight ahead, a little bit to the left.
And one that veers off to the direct left of you.
-speak Vex 
Which do we take?
-speak Vax 
Clarota, do you know anything about these passages?
-speak Clarota  
I've not been this far up these tunnels.
It's too dangerous this close to the war camp.
I would've been killed in a second.
-speak Vex 
What about the general's memory?
Anything there?
-speak Matt 
He closes his eyes for a second.
-speak Clarota  
One of these leads below, one of them leads to the surface.
I can't recall which.
-speak Grog 
Let's split up!
-speak Laura 
Can we go one and see if I sense any wind coming down?
-speak Matt 
As you're going to the one on the far left, you hear more impacts on the distant stone wall.
-speak Grog 
I think we just pick one here.
-speak Keyleth 
Are there any–
-speak Matt 
As you head to the tunnel, you don't sense any sort of temperature change, but it does seem to steady off into a decline that curves to the left.
-speak Vex 
This one.
-speak Percy 
Sounds good.
-speak Marisha 
Is there any wildlife, any bats, any type of animals, anything like that?
-speak Matt 
You look up, and unlike the previous sections, there are small clusters of bats on the ceiling.
-speak Marisha 
I'm going to go ahead and cast Beast Sense on one of the bats.
And I'm going to channel myself through the bat and I'm going to make him fly down the far left tunnel.
-speak Ashley 
Good call.
-speak Matt 
One of the bats heads down into the tunnel, continues into the darkness.
The echolocation is a very strange sensation.
You haven't really done this before for a bat and it's a very weird experience.
-speak Keyleth 
Wow, guys, this is really trippy.
-speak Matt 
It continues about a steady 40-degree decline that goes further and further down.
Eventually, you get to a point where the bat is out of your sphere of influence and you lose your connection to the bat.
-speak Vex 
Keep going down?
-speak Keyleth 
Well, I didn't really see much, but definitely there is a pretty steep decline.
We could try it again and go down the other one.
-speak Vax 
This is a coin flip.
-speak Vex 
I think we keep going down.
Just stick with it.
-speak Taliesin 
We go. With haste.
-speak Matt 
All righty.
-speak Travis 
With haste!
-speak Laura 
With Dust of Tracelessness behind us.
-speak Travis 
I'm the flower girl!
-scene set6
-background black
-speak Matt 
The tunnel itself is about 30 feet wide, 20 feet tall.
A slow, continuously gradual decline, curving to the left.
Like a spiral, downward.
-speak Vex 
Can you do another wall?
-speak Keyleth 
I'm tapped.
-speak Grog 
Maybe we could do a cave-in.
-speak Vex 
Well, that might be dangerous.
-speak Grog 
Yeah, but it'd be fun.
-speak Matt 
You guys continue for another 20 or so minutes down.
You come across a small alcove to the right, but the tunnel continues.
The alcove is about 40 feet in, and you can see remnants of a previous camp.
-speak Liam 
Any useful shit?
-speak Vex 
Can we go in?
We should rest, heal up, get our spells back.
Can you cast the illusion terrain and make it look like there's no hole in the cavern here?
-speak Keyleth 
No, I can't today. I'm sorry.
I can make it really foggy.
-speak Liam 
Yes, we know that about you.
What about in the game, though?
-speak Marisha 
Well, that's a different story.
-speak Laura 
Can we go in and look at the camp?
-speak Matt 
Go ahead and make an investigate check.
-speak Laura 
20.
-speak Matt 
There are four tents still set up.
There appears to be the remains of a small campfire.
-speak Travis 
I have two firewood bundles.
-speak Taliesin 
I'm gonna look for a seal, to see if there's a seal anywhere around.
-speak Matt 
You do see, on one of the walls, a similar seal of Bahamut.
-speak Percy 
Bam!
-speak Vex 
Oh! This was her camp!
-speak Percy 
Kima was here!
-speak Keyleth 
#kimawashere.
-speak Matt 
However, there are four tents here.
-speak Travis 
She had babies.
-speak Matt 
Maybe it's been repurposed?
Or there were more people with her?
-speak Travis 
Oh.
-speak Matt 
However, glancing through, you do notice that there are a few discarded travel bags–
-speak Laura 
Mine! Mine! Mine!
-speak Marisha 
Ooh!
-speak Matt 
There's rope, grappling hooks, general cluster of torches.
-speak Laura 
Okay, that's nice. 
-speak Travis 
Thank you! Bag of holding, bag of holding.
-speak Matt 
Also.
As you glance about, it looks like there was a serious struggle here.
There's scuff marks in the dirt, and then drag marks.
-speak Laura 
Can I use survival and see what happened, like Prince Humperdink, please?
-speak Matt 
Yeah, this is still part of your Investigation roll.
Unless you want to track to where the tracks went, that's a different story.
-speak Laura 
Does it look like Kima was attacked, or she–
-speak Matt 
It's hard to tell. 
The duergar have a very distinct footprint.
You do see a few that are most likely of halfling origin.
There's some scratch marks in the walls, fresh rock exposed from underneath a layer of soot.
-speak Laura 
The drag marks, do they lead outside of the alcove and down?
-speak Matt 
They do, further into the tunnel.
-speak Grog 
Are we resting?
-speak Vex 
Do we need to rest?
-speak Vax 
I think we should rest.
-speak Vex 
I feel like we need to get our spells back, otherwise we're just gonna get killed.
-speak Keyleth 
Are we being chased right now?
-speak Percy 
Possibly.
-speak Keyleth 
Are people hot on our tail?
-speak Percy 
We can rest in shifts.
-speak Grog 
I'll stay awake.
-speak Vax 
I'm totally fine at the moment, so I'll stay awake too.
-speak Keyleth 
I need to sleep.
-speak Vex 
Maybe seal the entrance to this alcove?
-speak Marisha 
So, I can't cast Wall of Stone again.
But, I do have a 3rd level spell slot.
Can I use Plant Growth to grow like, a thick curtain of vines? Try and hide the alcove?
-speak Matt 
For sure. Make a straight wisdom check for me, just for the hell of it.
-speak Marisha 
Natural 20.
-speak Matt 
So you use your spell, and these thick, dark green vines snake down from the cave ceiling.
If you look closely, you can still see the alcove, but in the dark its almost completely unnoticable.
So you guys end up making camp, are you guys lighting a fire?
Or are you keeping it dark?
What's your plan?
-speak Grog 
I've got two firewood bundles in the Bag of Holding.
-speak Percy 
I don't think we need a fire.
-speak Vax 
I don't think it's a good idea.
-speak Vax 
We're fine.
Let's just go into one of these tents.
-speak Grog 
I wanna burn something.
-speak Vex 
I know.
-speak Keyleth 
Yeah, two to a tent.
-speak Grog 
I wanted to pyro shit.
-speak Liam 
I pull out some dice, so that Grog and I can gamble while everyone are sleeping.
-speak Grog 
Ooh!
-speak Matt 
Fair enough.
-speak Taliesin 
Do I have time to do a quick engineering feat, as well?
I want to make an explosive arrow.
I'm just in a mood.
-speak Matt 
Do you have any currently built explosives?
-speak Taliesin 
No, but I have gunpowder.
-speak Matt 
You know what, I'll let you go ahead and try it.
It's gonna be a difficult.
-speak Matt 
You manage to fasten what appears to be a black powder, impact-based explosive to the tip of an arrow.
It's a little weighty and unwieldy, it might not be the most accurate thing in the world, but if it hits it's probably gonna pack a punch.
-speak Percy 
I have another gift.
-speak Vex 
You do?
-speak Percy 
Explosive arrow!
-speak Vex 
This is the best day ever!
-speak Percy 
It's a bit iffy.
-speak Keyleth 
Don't trust it!
-speak Percy 
It's a bit iffy.
-speak Laura 
I gingerly put it in my quiver.
-speak Grog 
Can you make me an explosive axe?
-speak Percy 
I don't think you want an explosive axe.
-speak Grog 
Why?
-speak Matt 
It's heavy in the tip.
It's one of those things where, you know, shooting it is going to be an interesting challenge.
-speak Laura 
Should I keep it away from the rest of my stuff?
-speak Matt 
That's up to you!
-speak Laura 
Is there a possibility it could explode just–
-speak Taliesin 
It's very unlikely to explode by itself.
It needs to be moving at a high speed.
But it's just not the best thing ever.
-speak Laura 
Maybe I won't keep it straight behind my head.
-speak Matt 
As the evening transpires, you all get your evenings of rest, Vax and Grog gambling away.
At a certain point in the evening, you hear something.
You begin hearing footsteps, many footsteps.
-speak Liam 
Many footsteps.
-speak Matt
Six people, ten people, more–
-speak Liam 
From up? Or down.
-speak Matt 
From above.
-speak Liam 
Grog and I are the only ones awake, right?
-speak Vax 
Do we lay low, and hold quiet in these tents?
Or do we get everyone up?
-speak Grog 
Lay low. Let them come.
-speak Vax 
I think so.
-speak Liam 
I rouse my sister quietly.
-speak Vex 
What? What's going–
-speak Vax 
Quiet.
-speak Matt 
Leaving the rest asleep?
-speak Liam 
Yeah.
-speak Matt 
The three of you make a stealth check.
-speak Laura 
God damn. Natural 1.
I should stop rolling this fucking dice.
-speak Travis 
17 for me.
-speak Liam 
23.
-speak Travis 
Yeah. Wake up your sister.
It was just us boys, and then you woke her up.
-speak Matt 
Between the three of you, thankfully, you had two successes against one failure.
You manage to cover for your sister, mumbling out loud while still half-asleep.
-speak Vex 
Ah– what? What?
-speak Vax 
Sh! Sh.
-speak Matt 
You guys wait quietly.
-narrate 
Matt rolls a die, and visibly reacts to the number.
-speak Travis 
Oh no, that was a bad expression!
-speak Liam 
Daggers out! Daggers out!
-speak Ashley 
Or that was good?
-speak Laura 
Oh no. Did eyebrows go up?
-speak Matt 
The footsteps progress through.
They don't have a light source, as duergar for the most part do not require light to see in the tunnels.
It's pitch black. You just hear the footsteps go by.
-speak Grog 
Good thing we didn't make a campfire!
-speak Vax 
Sh, sh!
-speak Matt 
You hear them approach the outskirts of the alcove.
A few moments pass, and the footsteps continue downward into the tunnel.
Silence once again takes the camp, you breathe a sigh of relief and remove your hand from Vex's face.
-speak Grog 
Well, maybe just leave it there.
-speak Vax 
Last time I did that I got kicked in the nuts, very hard.
-speak Grog 
And liked it.
-speak Matt 
Eventually, when you feel enough time has passed, your friends wake up, spells recovered, wounds are healed.
Except for those who didn't sleep, you guys maintain the same health you had previously.
-speak Pike 
What a good sleep I've had!
I have all my spells back!
-speak Matt 
There is one level of exhaustion on both of you currently.
-speak Liam 
Sure. So what does that do to us?
-speak Matt 
So, any ability checks you take are at disadvantage until you get a full night's rest.
You all eventually come back to consciousness, in this darkened alcove, pitch black.
And that's where we're going to go to break.
-narrate 
The cast take their mid-episode break, and then rejoin.
-speak Matt 
Welcome back, guys.
All right, I think everyone is sufficiently rested and bathroom breaked.
So as you all regain consciousness and prepare yourselves for the day ahead.
Once again, you've gone a number of days without sunlight, without any vision of the sky.
It's a very disorienting experience for those of you who are unfamiliar with subterranean territory.
Even though you are rested, you don't feel rested.
There's kinks in your back from the rocky floor.
Most of you sleep in your armor out of necessity and paranoia.
You all gather your things, you group together and you can continue in whichever direction you wish.
-speak Ashley 
Down.
-speak Travis 
Yeah, we're going down.
-speak Laura 
Stealth!
-speak Liam 
We should be aware that there are duergar ahead of us now.
-speak Keyleth 
Before we leave, I wanna go ahead and take a minute to meditate.
If you guys can, you know, just watch while I meditate.
-speak Percy 
Oh god.
-speak Vex 
And lend our energy to you.
-speak Keyleth 
Yes, if you guys could lend your positive energy it would be very helpful.
-narrate 
Travis make fart noises.
-speak Marisha 
So I can Commune With Nature.
-speak Matt 
What's the reach of that one?
-speak Marisha 
Three miles.
-speak Matt 
The only natural entities that you can sense in this cavern system are the bats you guys passed on your way down.
That's about it.
I mean, there are other strange things living down here, but they wouldn't be anything that would ping on Commune with Nature.
-speak Grog 
What do you see?
-speak Keyleth 
Lots of bats.
They're very nice bats.
-speak Grog 
Well, that's good.
-speak Keyleth 
Very pleasant, they're very friendly.
That's about it.
-speak Vex 
Bats.
-speak Keyleth 
Okay, carry on, let's go.
Thank you for your positive energy.
-speak Matt 
All right, you guys step back into the tunnel, heading further down.
About 15 minutes of travel go by and the very air itself is becoming steadily warmer.
-speak Percy 
It's humid in here.
-speak Matt 
There's a smell of groundwater, mixed with brimstone.
-speak Vax 
Smells like Grog.
-speak Travis 
I would like to trip Vax.
As he's walking.
-speak Liam 
I insult you and you trip me in a half a second?
Would you like to take a shot at my nads as well?
-speak Laura 
You knew it was coming, as well.
-speak Matt 
Make an athletics check.
-speak Travis 
Yes! 24!
-speak Matt 
Make an acrobatics check.
-speak Travis 
Suck it, elf.
-speak Liam 
What goes around comes around, baby.
Didn't beat it. 22.
-speak Matt 
You faceplant into the dirt.
-speak Grog 
Yes!
-speak Matt 
A slight bruise on the cheek.
-speak Percy 
For god's sake.
-speak Liam 
I'm going to voluntarily erase one hit point.
-speak Grog 
What, what happened?
Did you not stealth past that little pebble?
-speak Vax 
It's all right, when the illithid general is bearing down on your walnut-sized brain–
-speak Grog 
Yeah?
-speak Vax 
I may be there, I may not.
-speak Pike 
Hey! Don't be rude to him!
-speak Vex 
You guys, you guys.
-speak Grog 
Oh, I'm so happy right now.
-speak Vex 
These caverns are getting to us.
-speak Matt 
Clarota shuffles alongside you guys.
-speak Grog 
That's all I wanted.
-speak Pike 
Lack of oxygen.
-speak Vex 
We're going crazy down here.
-speak Keyleth 
Pike, did you ever fully tell us what you saw in your vision?
I mean, have you perhaps had any more visions?
-speak Pike 
Well, I saw what we've been going through already.
And what the general was talking about.
So I saw a single twisted horn of blackened soul matter.
-speak Keyleth 
Soul matter?
-speak Vax 
Sounds dirty.
-speak Pike 
It was a point of concentrated evil.
And it was so strong that I couldn't stay in the vision, because I could feel that it was taking over.
-speak Vax 
Did you see any whales?
-speak Pike 
I didn't see whales.
-speak Vex 
Okay, no narwhals.
-speak Pike 
I went past a jagged onyx-colored fortress framed in molten rock.
-speak Vex 
I think that's probably the place we're going to.
-speak Vax 
That sounds creepy.
-speak Pike 
Past a field of broken glass and bone.
-speak Keyleth 
We haven't seen that.
-speak Pike 
And the prettiest was into a cavern of blue crystal, where a fungal fortress–
-speak Vex 
Did the blue gemstones look valuable?
-speak Pike 
A fungal fortress intertwined with an ancient city of marble and jade.
-speak Clarota  
Where the colony resides.
-speak Vex 
Your colony?
-speak Clarota  
Our great city.
-speak Marisha 
That's Yug'Voril?
-speak Clarota  
Surrounded by the forest.
The city of Yug'Voril.
That is where the temple resides, where K'varn holds the Elder Brain.
-speak Vex 
Ah.
-speak Vax 
He sounds like a real fun-guy.
-speak Grog 
Oh god.
-speak Percy 
Trip him again, trip him again.
-speak Keyleth 
Trip him again!
-speak Matt 
Make a wisdom saving throw.
-speak Ashley 
Oh my god.
-speak Liam 
12.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you feel a mental slap as Clarota glares at you from across the tunnel.
-speak Clarota  
There'll be none of that in my presence.
-speak Travis 
You got bitch-slapped.
-speak Clarota  
I hate puns.
-speak Vax 
Noted, noted.
-speak Vex 
So I bet, first fortress you saw, is where Lady Kima is being held.
The general mentioned molten lava.
So she's being held there and then further in is K'varn.
-speak Clarota  
The Emberhold.
-speak Vex 
Emberhold, yes.
Is that an obsidian fortress?
-speak Clarota  
It is black and jagged, I think, yes.
-speak Vex 
Well, let's keep going that way.
-speak Keyleth 
So the ultimate question is, are we heading the right way?
Are we heading the right way, Pike, do you know?
-speak Pike 
Hmm... 
-speak Matt 
You guys are unfamiliar with this tunnel, Clarota is unfamiliar with this tunnel.
All you know is it's going down.
That's better than up.
-speak Pike 
I feel like that's the way we need to go.
-speak Vex 
So, just keep going, then?
-speak Percy 
Let's keep going.
-speak Matt 
You guys press forward.
And you begin to encounter little trickles on the ceiling of orange, glowing little puddles.
-speak Laura 
Avoid that!
-speak Marisha 
If we learned anything from Minecraft–
-speak Laura 
Don't touch that.
-speak Matt 
Progressing further down, you start seeing little pools of molten rock.
You also begin to hear some additional footsteps to your own.
Further down the tunnel.
-speak Laura 
Can we stealth, can we stealth?
And my favored terrain is the Underdark.
-speak Matt 
It is.
-speak Laura 
I don't know what that means, though.
Because I tried to look it up and couldn't find it.
-speak Ashley 
You just love it.
-speak Laura 
Does it give me an advantage?
-speak Matt 
Here, there's a sheet that has all the information you need.
-speak Laura 
Oh good, thank you.
-speak Vax 
Everyone, there's footsteps coming from ahead.
Let Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead.
Wait for a moment.
-speak Vex 
Let's go.
-hide keyleth
-hide grog
-hide clarota
-hide scanlan

-speak Matt 
Stealth checks, both of you.
-speak Liam 
22 for me.
-speak Laura 
22!
Twinsies.
-speak Matt 
All right, so you guys vanish into the darkness.
The little points of glowing light appear every 100 or so feet.
You hear more footfalls- very slow, heavy.
The footprints are larger and set wider than those of a normal humanoid.
-speak Travis 
Ah, let me play. Please.
-speak Liam 
Well it's definitely not duergar.
How far ahead of us do they sound?
-speak Matt 
Probably a good 60, 70 feet.
You hear some muttering.
-speak Laura 
Can I understand what they're saying?
-speak Matt 
No.
-speak Liam 
I'm listening, trying to make out how many sets of footsteps I can hear.
-speak Laura 
And I look on the ground and see if I can find multiple sets of footsteps as well.
-speak Matt 
Looking on the ground, you guys have no light source currently.
It's pitch black.
-speak Liam 
But there's lava spilling and we can see in dim light.
-speak Matt 
Fair!
You can see there are a number of tracks, up and down.
All different sizes.
This tunnel is traversed quite a lot.
Listening, you hear two sets of heavy footsteps.
And you hear what sounds like some sort of squeak sound.
-speak Liam 
Cart?
Could be some sort of device–
-show ogre 3
-showanother ogre 9
-speak Matt 
From around a corner, you can just barely make out these two lumbering humanoid shapes.
-speak Liam 
Can we tell what they are?
-narrate 
Matt rolls a die.
-speak Laura 
Oh, he's trying to see if they spot us.
-speak Liam 
Yes.
-speak Matt 
They begin to step towards your direction.
-speak Laura 
We back away.
-speak Matt 
You guys flatten yourself against the wall.
-speak Liam 
Separate sides.
-speak Matt 
You can see they're now both dragging behind them this small roughshod cart, with something inside it.
-speak Laura 
We string a rope across the tunnel.
-speak Matt 
Okay, you pull it across.
-speak Marisha 
Oh, yeah!
-narrate 
Matt imitates the low grumbling and mumbling of the creatures.
-speak Liam 
I also yank my serpentine belt off and throw it out, right under the rope.
-speak Laura 
What does that do?
-speak Liam 
Snake.
-speak Matt 
So, as he throws the leather, the leather shifts form suddenly in midair into a serpent.
It slithers in place, curling up at the approaching entities.
-speak Laura 
That is stupid.
-speak Liam 
Yes, it is.
-speak Laura 
This is gonna go really poorly.
-speak Matt 
As they begin to cross in front of you, you both pull taut on the rope.
-speak Laura 
This is dumb.
-speak Matt 
One immediately falls forward, tripping face-first on the ground, a heavy thud.
You guys hear in the distance this loud thud, impact sound.
-speak Vex 
Grog!
-speak Travis 
I'm raging.
-speak Liam 
And I leap out, daggers at the fallen one.
-speak Matt 
You guys come rushing in, let's go ahead and roll initiative.

As you pull the arrow out, it's a little wonky.
Despite its awkwardness, you manage to hit- it's a big creature.
You fire it.
It arcs slightly, smacks in the side of its chest and stomach area.
It's this cacophonous explosion sound that rocks the immediate vicinity.

The first arrow disappears.
The second one, as you release it from the bowstring, you feel the tingle of the arcane energy released into the arrow.
The arrow bursts into flame, piercing the front of its hide.
Both of its claws are at the edges of the lava, trying to pull itself free.
It's screeching, its mouth and eyes wild from the severe pain.
It's slowly melting him from the bottom.
It looks like it's having a really, really rough time making its way out.

What the fuck did we open?
-speak Travis 
Wait, my AC is 20 now?
Yes!
-narrate 
Travis does a shimmy of joy.
-speak Travis 
Yay! Yes!
-speak Vax 
Loaner! Loaner.
-speak Vex 
It's his, he's keeping it.
It's going to stink like Grog, you won't want that back.
-speak Grog 
The things I'm gonna do in this armor, you're not going to want it back.
Just give me and Scanlan one night to break it in, and I promise you, it will be mine.
-speak Matt  
Just the two of you?
-speak Grog 
Well, uh, you know what I mean.
Who am I talking to?
-speak Matt  
Percy, go ahead and roll an investigation check.
-speak Taliesin 
8.
-speak Matt  
Okay.
Looking at the cart, the cart is a rickety wooden thing.
But what was in the cart was a large glass unit, a containment unit that was sealed off.
You can see the inside of it has slight scarring to the glass, but it seems to be resistant to whatever the creature was.
Inside the cart, there are a couple of chunks of flesh of different colors.
Like part of a hand that's just in there.
-speak Laura 
Ew.
-speak Matt  
Partially decomposed.
It looks like these were either used to feed whatever the creature was?
Or remnants of some other strange collection.
This creature looks like it was part of the experiments that the weird naga also came from.
-speak Laura 
Oh, great, so there could be more.
-speak Travis 
Did we search the ogres?
-speak Laura 
Loot the ogres!
-speak Matt  
Ogres are wearing nasty, nasty hide armor
-speak Liam 
Grog could do it.
-speak Matt  
You find 24 gold pieces.
-speak Laura 
Sweet. I add it to party funds.
-speak Travis 
I am searching the ogres, and I keep the 24 gold, but I give two to Vax.
-speak Liam 
Thank you.
-speak Travis 
You're welcome.
-speak Marisha 
Can I go and grab shards of the broken glass of the case?
-speak Matt  
If you'd like to, yeah.
-speak Travis 
And two to Pike for healing me.
-speak Ashley 
Oh, thanks.
-speak Liam 
I guess we should just start walking further down.
-speak Travis 
I'd like to take a hit dice.
-speak Matt  
Go ahead and do that.
-speak Liam 
Let's rest for a half-hour or so.
-speak Laura 
Yeah.
-speak Matt  
Take a moment, you can spend any dice as you rest.
Eventually you pull yourselves back up to your feet, and you tread further down this tunnel.
Another 30 minutes, as ot gets steeper and steeper.
Until eventually it opens up into a familiar cavern to some of you.
You see a large waterfall pouring down.
-speak Laura 
Mother bitches.
-speak Marisha 
It looped around?
-speak Matt  
You are on the outskirts of the cavern, a few small streams of lava pouring from the ceiling.
There's the giant lake beneath.
Across the way, you can see the waterfall where Clarota was originally discovered.
-speak Marisha 
Well, we should go pick up Trinket.
-speak Taliesin 
At least you get your bear.
-speak Laura 
Trinket!
-speak Marisha 
Let's go pick up Trinket.
-speak Laura 
We'll go get Trinket, and then we'll go down the path we should have gone down in the first place next week.
-speak Marisha 
Son of a bitch.
-speak Laura 
But Trinket!
-speak Marisha 
So it's not useless.
-speak Laura 
It was absolutely useless.
-speak Liam 
That's fate, that's kismet.
-speak Matt  
Other than the fact you've completely destroyed one of the mind flayers and a duergar general.
You've acquired new magical items and defeated one of the abominations that was created for the siege war.
I think you accomplished quite a few things, though maybe not as directly as you were hoping.
-speak Taliesin 
And we acquired our bear.
-hide keyleth
-show gianteagle -4
-speak Marisha 
I'll fly up as an eagle and pick up Trinket.
-speak Matt  
All right, so you pick him up, and manage to bring him down to join the rest of the group.
As you make your way to the lakeshore, you can see a swish to the water.
A slick domed fish-like head protrudes, along with a few tentacles.
You all instinctively step quite a distance away, and it seems to withdraw back into the water.
-speak Marisha 
I'm going to go ahead and channel and cast Beast Sense through it.
-speak Matt  
Nothing bestial of it.
This is not a natural creature.
-speak Marisha 
Good to know.
-speak Clarota   
Stay at bay.
The Aboleth is dangerous.
-speak Matt  
You all step back and turn now into the tunnel that extends further into the heart of this mountain.
You see streams of lava pouring from the top occasionally.
One central flow fills half of the cavern, like a small river heading down into the base of the mountain.
Pike, this is very familiar to you, as it's the path that your dream took you.
-speak Pike 
Guys, this is really familiar to me.
-speak Laura 
We spent a whole game doing–
-speak Marisha 
Well, we took a wrong turn, I guess.
-speak Liam 
I don't know.
We were flexing our muscles a little bit.
-speak Laura 
Plus Grog got new armor out of it.
-speak Travis 
And I got naked, too.
-speak Matt  
As you guys begin to step into the next lengths of your subterranean journey, we'll pick that up next week.
Thank you all so much for tuning into Critical Role!
Good night!
