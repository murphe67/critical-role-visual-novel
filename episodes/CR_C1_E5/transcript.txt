-speak Matt 
All right, you take 11 points of piercing damage.
-speak Laura 
Okay.
-speak Matt 
Wherever she is.
And the other one misses, clanging against the armor.
The hook scrapes across metal, leaving this extremely loud sound.
The other one goes twice against Tiberius.
That is a 16.
-speak Orion 
A 17.
-speak Matt 
And a nine.
Both miss.
Barely getting out of the way.
This giant, large, armored creature.
-speak Ashley 
Falling from the ceiling.
-speak Matt 
Right there, take a look– All right, that ends that, so top of the round.
Tiberius, you're up.
-speak Orion 
Oh, I look at him with a funky grin.
-speak Matt 
All right.
-speak Orion 
It's a funky one.
How much does he weigh?
800 pounds?
-speak Matt 
Pretty heavy.
Say probably close to 500-600 pounds.
-speak Orion 
Ah, beautiful.
I cast Telekinesis and I hurl him over my head and chuck him at the other one.
I want to get him away from Pike.
I don't think I can throw him that far.
How far away is he from the lava, actually?
-speak Matt 
It's about right there.
It's about 35 feet.
-speak Ashley 
I'm okay.
I have a lot of armor.
-speak Laura 
She's good.
-speak Orion 
Then I'll try that instead.
I'll try to slam dunk.
-speak Matt 
He makes a saving throw.
That fails entirely.
So the creature in front of you lifts up in the air, and starts flailing about with its hooks, trying to find some purchase in the ceiling.
You toss it over, and it lands squarely into the pool of lava in the center of the tunnel.
You hear screeching in pain as it begins trying to find his way out.
Okay.
-speak Liam 
Yes!
Yes!
-speak Marisha 
I like lava pools.
I like lava pools.
-speak Matt 
As it's fully submerged, all right, that is 45 points of fire damage on it immediately as it's slowly sinking into the pool of lava.
-speak Travis 
He starts sinking into the pool of lava?
-speak Ashley 
Whoa.
-speak Matt 
Tiberius just Telekinesis-ed him up in the air, and threw it into the lava pool.
-speak Travis 
Yes.
-speak Laura 
Good job.
-speak Orion 
I use two sorcerer points, and with the other one I do Glacial Blast at the other guy.
-speak Matt 
The other one there?
Okay.
Go ahead and roll– Add your–
-speak Laura 
Damn, Tiberius is getting really freaking cool.
Badass.
-speak Orion 
Spell attack, right?
-speak Matt 
Yeah.
