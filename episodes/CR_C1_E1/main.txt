-speak Matt
Hello everyone.
My name is Matthew Mercer, voice actor and Dungeon Master for Critical Role.
This is where I take a bunch of other voice actors and run them through a fantasy adventure, in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.
All right! Let's jump on in.
Let's give you a little backstory.
The party has just saved the nearby city of Emon, the capital of the human civilization of Tal'Dorei.
They managed to halt a demonic insurrection, and were given a hero's celebration, as well as a keep built in their honor.
Over the six month period of its construction, they went their own ways.
On reuniting, Arcanist Allura Vysoren, one of their good friends and allies, came to them requesting aid.
Lady Kima of Vord, a very well respected halfling paladin of Bahamut, left on a pilgrimage.
Essentially a vision quest.
She told Allura that a dark vision had come to her, that evil is beginning to breed beneath Kraghammer.
Kraghammer being the largest Dwarven city in Tal'Dorei, which is closed to outsiders.
Allura offered you a very substantial reward to find Lady Kima of Vord, and organized entry for you to the city.
On the way, you were ambushed by a group of roaming barbarian goliaths, Grog recognizing one of them.
-speak Travis
Son of a bitch.
-speak Matt
Yep, Grog for the first time managed to avoid battle through a social encounter.
You got your one.
Never again.
-speak Travis
Next time he dies.
-speak Matt
You continued on your way to Kraghammer, presented your paperwork, were given entry into the city.
And that is where we begin this adventure.
-scene Arrival at Kraghammer
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Sam
In the city of Kraghammer?
-speak Matt
In the city of Kraghammer.
-speak Sam
Wow! This is fantastic.
-speak Travis
We're in, right?
-speak Marisha
Yes.
We were at the door.
We were talking to someone right?
-speak Matt
Yeah, you were talking to the front guards at the gate of Kraghammer.
They have begrudgingly let you inside.
Giving you a couple of pointers, little prods and sent you into the city proper.
You made your way through the darkened alleyways, stone carved tunnels, that lead into the main, central portion of the city.
An enormous underground metropolis sprawls out before you.
Beautiful stone work, marble columns, archways.
Labyrinthine bridges climbing across the vertical cityscape.
All warmed with the red glow of some strange, crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a light source.
A large metal forge envelops the center of this cylindrical city.
This three-tiered cylindrical city that is built into the ground of the mountain itself.
Welcome to Kraghammer!
-speak Liam
Remind us, did we bullshit our way in here, or did–
-speak Laura
No, we had a way in.
-speak Matt
No, Allura got your paperwork so you were actually able to get in this time.
-speak Laura
But, Ashley speaks Dwarvish. Pike speaks–
-speak Matt
Pike speaks Dwarvish.
The only other bit of information you have about Kima's whereabouts is that she came here to go into the mine.
Apparently, a mithral mine is where this evil is brewing.
The one person who owns the biggest part of the mithral market here, you heard his name was Lord Nostoc Greyspine.
That was the only name you had in regards to this mithral mine.
-speak Sam
Greyspine?
-speak Matt
Greyspine, correct.
-speak Scanlan
We have to go find him, don't we?
-speak Percy
I think before we do anything we should find a place to sleep.
-speak Grog
Oh! We're all jacked up from before, right?
-speak Percy
Wouldn't it be nice to put everything down for a little while.
-speak Scanlan
Of course.
I've got a lot of booty that I need to stow.
-speak Vax
Let's look around.
-speak Liam
Are there any dwarves in the vicinity?
-speak Matt
Oh, there are many! 
-show carver1 5
-show carver 3
-continue
As you finish this conversation you look about there are two guards posted nearby.
They're wearing dark crimson and brass chest plates that have a uniform scar carved across the front.
It's actually built into the armor itself as a design.
They're both staring awkwardly at all of you arguing in the middle of this entry thoroughfare of Kraghammer.
-speak Vax
My associates and I were looking for a place of lodging for the night.
-speak Matt
One dwarf shouts over to another one.
-speak Dwarf Guard
You hear that, Jepson?! They're looking for a place to "stay."
-speak Other Dwarf Guard
Aye, I heard that right.
It's about time we had some new folk in town.
Well, if you're 'looking for a place to stay', I'd say your best bet would be the Pig Pits.
-speak Scanlan
Is that the name of a place?
-speak Dwarf Guard
Yes! Certainly! The Pig Pits.
-speak Scanlan
All right.
-speak Dwarf Guard
Ask for the Pig Pits–
-speak Vex
Those are actual pig pits, aren't they?
-speak Keyleth
I feel like we're being hazed.
-speak Dwarf Guard
What?! No! Not at all.
-speak Grog
That sounds fine with me.
-speak Liam
This is Common?
-speak Dwarf Guard
This is all in Common, yeah.
-speak Sam
Which way to the Pig Pits, sir?
-speak Dwarf Guard
Pig Pits are that way.
-speak Matt
He points over the edge and you see down past the central forge structure in the city to the very bottom nearby a large temple that envelops the bottom floor of Kraghammer proper there is indeed a distant slop of mud where internal livestock are being kept.
-speak Laura
I bring out a piece of gold.
-speak Vex
Please, sir, we're looking for a place to stay that isn't covered in mud.
-speak Dwarf Guard
It's good to see that at least one of you speaks Dwarvish.
-speak Matt
Takes the coin, kinks it in his teeth and goes:
-speak Dwarf Guard
All right, now if you're looking for a proper place to stay you're going to look for the Iron Hearth Tavern.
That is to your left up that way no more than a half mile.
Keep an eye out. Listen for the laughter and the people who are very drunk.
That's your best bet.
-speak Vex
Thank you, sir.
-speak Dwarf Guard
No worries.
-speak Vex
I like your armor by the way.
-speak Dwarf Guard
Well, thank you kindly.
-hide carver
-hide carver1
-speak Travis
Was that a wink?
-speak Laura
It was.
-speak Liam
That's all she does.
-speak Laura
That's all I do is wink at people.
-speak Liam
It's a nervous tic, really.
-speak Matt
It's a feat she took.
-scene Getting rooms at the Iron Hearth Tavern
-continue
You progress to the western side of Kraghammer as you curve around the central platform.
Making your way eventually to the outside of this large inn.
You can hear music playing, you can hear laughter and boastful cheer, you can hear some arguments in the distance.
You can hear it from a good two or three buildings away, this is definitely a central social environment here in Kraghammer.
-background bricks
-continue
As you walk in, the first thing that catches you is the scent of stale alcohol and smoked wood of some kind.
-speak Scanlan
Smells in here.
-speak Grog
Drinking territory.
-speak Matt
There are tables, most of them in decent condition, some of them half-broken and repaired, probably from some previous bar brawl.
In the center of the room, there looks to be a specifically built brawling circle.
It's about 30 feet by 20 feet. It's more of an oval.
It's not in use, currently.
-speak Sam
An octagon?
-speak Matt
Essentially.
-speak Liam
How high is the ceiling here? Can Grog fit in here?
-speak Travis
Oh right, am I like–?
-speak Matt
The ceiling actually is considered vaulted ceiling for dwarves so it runs at about seven feet.
For Grog, it's uncomfortable, almost scratching your head across the top.
-show dwarfwoman3 6
-show dwarfman2 8
-show dwarfwoman2 9
-show dwarfman3 5
-continue
As you enter, about seven or eight of the nearby dwarves at the front door catch sight of him and start laughing.
Looking immediately at this ragtag non-dwarven group that just stumbled into the center of the tavern.
-speak Grog
What're you looking at?
-speak Dwarf
It's not very often we get someone with that kind of a mug on you.
Let me buy you a drink, come sit down!
-speak Grog
My kind of people, see you later! 
-speak Travis
I go grab the drink with the lovely dwarves.
-speak Laura
We grab a table next to the dwarves with Grog.
-speak Matt
Both tables next to the table they're at are completely filled with dwarves.
-speak Liam
I take a sack of gold out of my own pocket, slam it down on the table–
-speak Laura
A sack of gold, are you crazy?!
-speak Vax
Ladies and gentlemen, we are traveling from far away. We just arrived from Emon.
We are fascinated to see your underground city and to celebrate the occasion I would like to buy every dwarf in here a round.
Bartender!
-speak Matt
The music stops.
The conversation stops.
All dwarven eyes turn to the table, and then they all turn to a single dwarven woman in the back who's behind one of the bars, who has a towel over one arm.
-show adra 2
-continue
She's looking around, she's staring confused at you and all eyes are on her, and she goes:
-speak Bartender
Well, it's about time someone around here had some generosity! Certainly, pay upfront.
Drinks all around on this half-elven gentleman.
-speak Vax
Let it rain!
-speak Keyleth
Make it rain.
-speak Grog
I would like a cask of ale.
-speak Vax
I'll need your largest bowl of ale for this one here.
-speak Grog
Cask.
Cask of ale. Cask.
-speak Adra
No worries, Adra's got your back, be right back.
-speak Matt
She wanders off to the back room, comes back and starts pouring stein after stein after stein of ale.
-speak Grog
Yeah.
Keep going.
Looks good.
-speak Matt
You do notice she is definitely the head of this tavern and all of her barkeeps are male and seem to be worked rather ragged.
-speak Laura
What was her name?
-speak Matt
Adra.
-speak Scanlan
Excuse me, miss.
-speak Adra
Yeah?
-speak Scanlan
Adra! You run a fantastic establishment.
-speak Adra
That's right I do!
-speak Scanlan
Thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to buy this round.
-speak Adra
Of course.
Patrons that come and drop coin like that are welcome any time.
-speak Sam
Well, thank you for your hospitality.
Might we inquire about staying here the night? Do you have an inn with the establishment?
-speak Matt
She reaches below and pulls out a big tome and starts thumbing through it.
-speak Adra
You know, we have openings right now on the second floor.
-speak Scanlan
Several rooms, or just one?
-speak Adra
Do you need them side by side?
-speak Scanlan
That would be nice.
-speak Adra
We could pull him there and push him into room seven.
-speak Scanlan
Something with a little bed for me.
-speak Adra
Giles!
-speak Matt
One of the dwarf barmaiders comes over.
-speak Giles
Aye?
-speak Adra
Get Stepheson out of his room, move him to the third floor.
We have to open a block for our new guests.
-speak Giles
Ugh, fine.
-speak Matt
The older dwarf stumbles his way up the stairs begrudgingly.
-speak Adra
Right, so I can get a room for each of you.
We're looking at seven rooms separately, that will run you per evening about 25 gold pieces.
Does that sound about right?
-speak Grog
Total?
-speak Adra
25 total pieces.
-speak Scanlan
Oh, okay.
-speak Vex
You want to share a room?
-speak Keyleth
Yeah! We'll bunk up.
-speak Scanlan
Grog, you and me.
I can sleep on your feet.
-speak Vex
Probably like 15 gold then for just that amount.
-speak Matt
She visibly deflates a little bit.
-speak Adra
All right, fair enough.
Five rooms it is. 15 gold.
-speak Scanlan
We're penny pinchers.
-speak Adra
How long do you expect to stay?
-speak Scanlan
I'd say a week.
-speak Percy
With an indefinite hold, we have business in the city.
-speak Adra
Right! Well how bout we pay the week in advance and I'll give you a discount?
-speak Vex
What's the discount?
-speak Keyleth
Wait. I thought we were going to be heading south?
-speak Adra
Let's say, 100 gold for the week, all five rooms.
-speak Vax
We're pretty flush, I think we can handle it.
-speak Vex
Yes.
That works.
-speak Taliesin
This doesn't terrify me.
-speak Laura
I think I did the math wrong.
-speak Travis
I was told there would be no math.
-speak Scanlan
Sounds good!
-speak Laura
Gah! I hate not having a calculator! 
-speak Vex
Fine!
-speak Adra
Ah! Great!
-speak Matt
She pulls back and pulls some keys out and hands them to the rest of you.
Hands you some paperwork, shows you which rooms are yours.
-speak Adra
You're welcome to stay all you like, ask questions, hang about.
Just make sure you don't do anything stupid near the Carvers.
-speak Vax
Sorry.
Our Dwarvish is a little thick.
Near the–?
-speak Adra
The Carvers, the Carvers!
-speak Vex
The carvas.
Of course.
-speak Adra
The Carvers!
-speak Vax
The Converse! Of course!
-speak Scanlan
The Car Verse?
-speak Adra
Is this your first time in Kraghammer?
-speak Everyone
Yes!
-speak Adra
The Carvers are the guard that run this city.
They're the ones that keep the law.
-speak Vex
The scar!
-speak Adra
Yes, the armor, the Carvers!
-speak Grog
Yeah, what is with the scar? I've got one myself.
-speak Matt
She leans back and as you reveal the rather gnarled scar on your chest.
Two of the nearby dwarves go, yeah!
They chug down their drinks.
-speak Grog
Yeah! More drinking!
-speak Matt
They start showing their scars and are like
-speak Dwarf
Oh no! I got this one from an iron bolt!
-speak Matt
They start talking about different creatures they fought.
-speak Adra
Well, the Carvers are a bit of a– how do I put it? A military class in this city.
They run a very tight ship on the streets, so be careful.
-speak Percy
That shouldn't be a problem.
Mostly we are looking for Lord Greyspine, if I recall.
We have business with him.
-speak Vex
We might have business with you, if you've seen a halfling come through.
-speak Matt
She thinks to herself.
-speak Adra
There was a halfling woman, but she was staying at the Firebrook Inn.
-speak Vex
The Firebrook.
-speak Adra
The bottom floor, for a couple of weeks.
There was talk about her. She got in a few fights herself.
The one with the silver armor? That one? Yeah, she was a firebrand if ever I saw one.
Right up my alley, I like that one.
-speak Percy
How long ago would you say this was?
-speak Adra
Oh, she came through a few weeks ago.
I haven't seen her recently.
-speak Percy
Thank you. Perfect.
-speak Grog
Is there a champion of the circle of fighting in the tavern? Is there a reigning–
-speak Scanlan
Already, Grog?!
-speak Grog
Well, I have to know these things!
-speak Percy
He has to do something.
-speak Matt
She turns the barrel that she has on the table towards you a little bit and you can see the actual symbol, this burned image on the side that says, Balgus Brewery.
-speak Adra
That'll be Balgus, the one that supplies us with what you're drinking.
He's the undefeated champion.
But I don't think he's quite right to fight at the moment.
-hide dwarfman2

She points towards the very edge of the bar and you see one older grizzled dwarf.
Long gray hair pulled into straight braids in the back, big bushy beard that's all shoved up into his face because he's asleep, drunk as a skunk, on the edge of the bar.
-speak Grog
My type of dwarf.
Maybe we'll can use him as a merc later or something.
All right, another time then.

-speak Grog
Does it rain down here?
-speak Percy
I don't think they have rainy days.
-speak Adra
You said Greyspine?
-speak Vex
Yes, Greyspine.
-speak Percy
We are looking to set up a meeting.
-speak Adra
Which Greyspine?
-speak Sam
Nostoc?
-speak Adra
Nostoc Greyspine.
He's definitely a cut-throat business type one.
-speak Vex
Is there a friendlier Greyspine?
-speak Adra
The friendlier of the types would probably be the head of House Greyspine.
-speak Keyleth
Wait, how many Greyspines are there?
-speak Adra
Oh, well there's probably several at this point, I've lost track.
The family line's been going for a while.
However, of House Greyspine currently, Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine is the head of this entire city.
Voted in ten years ago, actually. He's head of the council.
-speak Keyleth
Ironkeeper what?
-speak Adra
Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine.
Gradim! You're– These commoners.
Learn to speak the language!
-speak Vax
Adra, may I ask, obviously we have no dwarves in our little party.
-speak Adra
Unfortunately.
-speak Vex
Unfortunately for us.
-speak Vax
Sorry, about that. You're very welcoming. We appreciate that.
How welcoming would you say the city is to outsiders?
-speak Adra
As long as you don't do anything stupid.
As long as you keep the coin flowing, and as long as you stay to the upper levels.
The lower levels you get to more of the business: the miners, the forges, the foundries.
When you get to the business areas, that's where the guard gets heavier and that's where folks don't like you poking near their money.
-speak Scanlan
So the lower levels would have the mithral mines?
-speak Adra
The mithral mine, aye.
-speak Scanlan
There's only one?
-speak Adra
There is one now.
It's all, and has been for quite some time, ran by House Greyspine.
The Keystone Quarry is what you're looking for.
-speak Vax
We're not really interested in that. We just want to see the city.
Our business is elsewhere.
-speak Adra
Yeah, I would not recommend it.
Not without proper business credentials on that. You'll end up being questioned very heavily.
-speak Vax
Sounds like a dirty business, anyway.
-speak Vex
Right.
-speak Grog
Yeah, you want to stay away from those miners Scanlan, that's a dirty business.
-speak Matt
She gives you a look almost like it was a slightly racist statement, but then passes it off because you paid her a lot of coin today.
-speak Keyleth
So racist.
-speak Vex
So, Nostock. You said that he's kind of a–?
-speak Adra
Well, there's a reason he's the one put in charge of the mines and the businesses and the foundries.
-speak Vex
Oh. Where is he located, exactly?
-speak Adra
Well, if he's not home at the actual Greyspine Manor– which is a sprawling house.
It contains all the ones who live there.
-speak Grog
We're going there!
-speak Adra
He's probably down by the Greyspine quarry itself, keeping an eye on the business there.
-speak Matt
There's a nearby dwarf having a few drinks, goes:
-speak Dwarf
Ah, Greyspine, there's been troubles round there! 
Apparently.
A friend of mine works there. Got a big, nasty scar last week.
Wouldn't even pay him for his time off to heal.
It's bullshit!
-speak Matt
He slams his drink down on the table.
-speak Scanlan
Down at the quarry?
-speak Dwarf
Aye.
-speak Keyleth
How did your friend get this nasty cut?
-speak Dwarf
He works there! Said there was things pouring out of the caves.
Goblins and the like!
-speak Scanlan
Goblins?
-speak Dwarf
Ah, goblins are nothing.
-speak Vex
Of course not.
-speak Dwarf
Seems there's something other than goblins poking out through this hole.
Just saying, that business is in for a serious problem if it doesn't change.
-speak Vex
Does your friend ever have drinks here?
-speak Dwarf
No. He's been sober for two years.
We're not friends anymore.
-speak Matt
Tugs on his beard a little bit.
-speak Keyleth
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I think.
-speak Scanlan
A lot to process.
-speak Matt
He pours another drink.
At which point, Adra slaps his hand.
-speak Adra
Pay for that. He bought one round!
-speak Matt
He finishes his drink and walks away.
-hide dwarfman3
-speak Scanlan
Thank you for your time, Adra.
Carry on with your evening.We'll seek you out if we have any more questions.
-speak Adra
Certainly. Now if you don't mind.
-speak Matt
She scoots you aside, and you see a line, a queue of dwarves behind her, with their empty cups, waiting to get to her to fill up the drinks that you bought.
-speak Keyleth
Oh, that's– we did promise that.

Enjoy, gentlemen! And ladies.

-speak Laura
What time of day is it?
-speak Matt
You just arrived, probably around 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, so you're probably pushing sunset right about now.
-speak Laura
Do dwarves carry the same schedule?
-speak Marisha
I don't know.
-speak Laura
Does anyone know?
-speak Taliesin
There's only one way to find out.
-speak Matt
Make an intelligence check!
-speak Travis
Oh! Roll it! You're the first one.
-speak Liam
First die rolling. Nice!
-speak Laura
18, plus, what is that? Investigation? Or insight?
-speak Matt
This would be a straight intelligence roll on this one, so your general knowledge of dwarves.
-speak Laura
Oh. 20, then.
-speak Matt
In your experience, you know dwarves, depending on their lifestyle and what they do for a living, their clocks can run differently.
But for the most part, they run in tandem with most other races just because it makes it easier for dealing with outside forces.
But, like I said, it's very variable.
There is no set, locked time of: this is morning, this is evening, they just sleep when they need to and wake up when they need to.
-speak Laura
All right. Good to know.
-speak Marisha
It's like living in Alaska.
-speak Laura
Right!
-speak Marisha
Dwarven Alaska.
-speak Scanlan
So what should we do?
-speak Vex
Check out the Firebrook Inn, yes.
That was where Lady Kima was staying.
Also, I think somebody should run reconnaissance on Greyspine Manor.
-speak Grog
Like stealth, you mean?
-speak Vax
Yes. I don't think we should try to go directly to the mines and find Nostoc.
-speak Vex
No.
-speak Scanlan
Agreed.
-speak Vax
No, I think maybe we should enlist the help of a dwarf here in the city to introduce us to Nostoc.
I mean, we're not trying to raise hell, or bring down a thousand dwarves upon us.
-speak Scanlan
Although, that does sound fun.
-speak Percy
There's no sense attempting to be subtle.
Everyone's going to know that we're here, and what we're looking for by morning.
-scene Chatting with the local drunk
-speak Grog
Why don't we get old Drunky Greybeard that's got his face down on the bar to do it?
-speak Vex
Yeah, but he's very– Well, let's ask him.
Maybe he's drunk enough to help us.
Saddle up, Grog!
-speak Grog
Me?
-speak Vex
People seem to like you here.
-speak Grog
Yeah, but I'm really– oh, that's true.
-speak Vax
You're the connoisseur.
-speak Grog
Maybe I'll part my armor, so he can see the scar.
Post up on the bar.
-speak Keyleth
Take him a drink!
-speak Grog
All right.
-speak Vex
Yes, take him a drink.
A very large drink.
-speak Travis
I would like to get the largest goblet you have of ale, and I would like to go over to, what was his name? Bulbous?

Matt snores.
-narrate
Travis clear his throat louder.
-speak Sam
I take out my flute and I play a little Healing Words spell and try to heal him of his drunkenness.
-speak Laura
Just a little of his drunkenness, not all of his drunkenness.
-speak Travis
He likes him drunk, so maybe like, half.
-speak Matt
You play your tune, a beautiful little tune that saunters through the air. 
Magical energies emanate from the notes you make, drift into his torso, glowing slightly.
-speak Balgus
Where's that blasted music coming from?
-speak Matt
His hand goes out and paws towards the flute.
-speak Scanlan
Huh, I don't know where that was coming from.
-speak Grog
I'm sorry to disturb you, your name is of great repute around these parts.
-speak Matt
He wipes a globule of drool that's crusted into his beard.
-speak Balgus
Aye, you've bothered me nap.
What do you want from Balgus?
-speak Grog
We were wondering if we might, perchance, acquire your knowledge about town, for a bit of a search.
-speak Laura
Talk to him about fighting first.
-speak Grog
Right, I hear you're a good fighter.
You look strong.
-speak Balgus
I've heard the same.
-speak Grog
Right.
How often do you get challengers in this tavern?
-speak Balgus
Not as often as I get woken up from my sleep.
Which is never.
Because only stupid people do that.
-speak Laura
Lost cause.
Abandon ship!
-speak Grog
Right.
-speak Travis
I have an intelligence of six, I know what I'm doing.
-speak Laura
Okay.
-speak Grog
There is a very pretty lady over there, with slightly pointy ears.
There's two of them! 
They were actually wanting to ask you a question if you wouldn't mind.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion roll.
-speak Travis
Me?!
-speak Sam
Why is he doing this?
-speak Laura
Why would you throw this to us?
-speak Marisha
I know!
-speak Travis
Because I was either going to fight him or I was going to throw boobs at him, and I went with boobs.
-speak Marisha
He realized he was sinking.
-speak Matt
That's level ten you get that, by the way.
Throw Boobs.
-speak Laura
Persuasion.
Oh! Good roll.
-speak Travis
19!
-speak Laura
Woo!
-speak Matt
He takes a moment, and grabs the drink that you prepared from his hand and downs it.
-speak Grog
Nice form.
-speak Balgus
You've got five minutes.
-speak Matt
Then he stretches his back a bit.
This gnarled hunch that he holds in his physical posture, flexes it a bit, and now you can see the rippling muscles that show beneath his tunic.
This is a built dwarf.
You don't know what past he's had, moving boulders or forging crazy iron shit, but there's a reason this guy has a reputation.
He stands up off of his stool, which you hear crack slighlty from how heavy he is.
This guy is solid muscle.
He saunters over, looks about for a second, almost like he's looking for his next target.
Sees the pointy ears, sees the pointy ears, sighs.
And then saunters up to the table, slams his hand down.
-speak Keyleth
Why is he coming towards us?
-speak Grog
Because I told him to.
Because you're supposed to ask him–
-speak Scanlan
Boobs!
-speak Vax
Steady as she goes, ladies.
-speak Matt
He sits down.
-speak Keyleth
You're better at this than I am.
-speak Balgus
You called for Balgus, why?
-speak Vex
Oh! Hello, Balgus.
-speak Keyleth
Hi, Balgus.
-speak Vex
We just heard you're so impressive and masculine.
-speak Keyleth
Yes!
-speak Vex
We really wanted to talk to you.
-speak Marisha
I reach out and I stroke his bicep.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion check.
-speak Liam
Heat it up.
-speak Laura
Roll so good.
-speak Marisha
I'm really low in charisma.
I'm really awkward.
Persuasion.
-speak Matt
Roll your persuasion.
-narrate
Taliesin groans when he sees the roll.
-speak Laura
Oh no, what was it?
-speak Marisha
I rolled a two?
-speak Matt
Plus?
-speak Marisha
Plus my persuasion of zero, because I have a shitty charisma.
-speak Matt
As your arm reaches for his bicep–
-speak Marisha
I didn't say anything.
I just touched him!
-speak Matt
As your arm reaches for his bicep, his hand, belying his grumpy, half-asleep haze, reaches out with unnatural speed and slaps your hand to the side.
Not painfully though.
-speak Balgus
No touching the drunk dwarf.
-speak Vex
Sorry about my friend, Balgus.
She's just so impressed with your muscles.
We've heard amazing things about you here.
-speak Balgus
Have you?
-speak Vex
We have.
-speak Balgus
Tell me, what have you heard?
-speak Vex
We've heard that no fighter can match your skill.
-speak Balgus
You've heard correct.
-speak Vex
We've heard that you know more about this town than anyone else.
-speak Balgus
I've been around a bit, yeah.
-speak Vex
Yeah.
I bet nobody knows more about the Greyspines than you do and they've been around a long time.
-speak Balgus
Political ass minds is what they are.
-speak Scanlan
Assmanes?
-speak Balgus
Not keen to them– ass minds.
-speak Keyleth
Ass mines?
-speak Balgus
They've got minds of an ass.
-speak Keyleth
Oh, I thought you meant like, mines that ex– Sorry.
Go ahead.
No, ass minds.
Yes, they have ass minds.
-speak Balgus
The Greyspines are no friend of mine.
-speak Vex
No, I've heard they're terrible.
What do you do, Balgus?
-speak Balgus
What do I do? I own the brewery in town!
-narrate
Laura gasps.
-speak Vex
You do?
-speak Balgus
The only one.
-speak Vex
The best brewery?
-speak Balgus
The only! Of course it's the best!
I've put everyone out of business.
We export to most of Tal'Dorei.
-speak Vex
This ale I'm drinking right now is amazing.
-speak Balgus
Damn right it is!
-speak Matt
You set it down and he takes it from your hand a little bit and takes a sip himself and sets it down again.
-speak Keyleth
It seems that you aren't challenged often in business and in fighting.
We're trying to find Nostoc Greyspine, but he doesn't seem very popular around here.
-speak Balgus
If you're looking to go ahead and talk to the Greyspines, you don't want to go empty-handed.
It's customary to come with a gift of some kind.
-speak Vex
Oh really?
-speak Scanlan
What might they like?
-speak Balgus
Well, let's just say, I have the finest brewery in the city.
-speak Vex
Oh!
-speak Balgus
I have some fine, very rare, very exotic drinks that I could, perchance, sell to you.
-speak Vax
Pay the dwarf.
-speak Vex
How much for this exotic ale?
-speak Balgus
How exotic you wanting?
-speak Vex
We want to get in the door.
We want him to like us.
-speak Balgus
I can give you the finest of thistle branch, dark blood wine.
This was crafted by myself, from a rare bloodthistle branch that I had brought over from the far-off city of Kamordah.
This, I personally oversaw.
It took me four years to fill this barrel full.
It'll cost you 500 gold pieces.
But it is a king's red wine!
-speak Marisha
Can I do a persuasion check– a perception check to see if he's lying?
-speak Matt
This would be insight.
Go ahead and roll insight.
-speak Taliesin
I'm going to go walk over to Grog really quickly.
-speak Marisha
27.
-speak Matt
He seems too drunk to lie.
-speak Sam
Let's just do it.
-speak Vex
Tell you what, Balgus.
We have some very rare items with us that I think you might be interested in.
-speak Balgus
Make it quick! You've got one minute.
-speak Vex
We've got one minute? Well, we've got–
-speak Balgus
My time already is worth far more than 500 gold.
-speak Vex
We've got this with us right now.
-speak Grog
We've got a bunch of dragon pieces.
We've got 37 dragon teeth, one dragon eye, four cups of dragon blood–
-speak Vex
We've got this cup of dragon blood! Which I know can be added to ale or wine and makes it quite sensational.
-speak Matt
He takes the sealed cup and sloshes it around in his hand.
The actual liquid is coagulated to such a point that it's less of a blood and more of a gelatin.
-speak Grog
It gets better with age.
-speak Vex
Exactly, a spoon of it!
-speak Matt
He peeks it open and sniffs.
-speak Laura
I think that's really expensive, actually.
-speak Balgus
I can have this appraised, but if you want to do a straight trade for the barrel for this, I'll take you up on that.
-speak Laura
Shit, no.
-speak Sam
Just go for it.
-speak Vex
All right, fine! One cup of it.
-speak Balgus
All right.
-speak Matt
He takes the cup, puts it in a small satchel on his side.
-speak Balgus
Adra!
-show adra 8
-speak Adra
Aye, what do you want, you drunken bastard?
-speak Balgus
They've bought me thistle blood wine.
Take it out back.
Here's the key.
-speak Matt
He tosses her the key.
She grabs it and goes:
-speak Adra
Really? Ooh, just walked in, they're buying fancy.
-speak Matt
She comes back with two of her barmaiders who are begrudgingly carrying it with her.
It's a nice barrel. It has a gold trim.
The actual bands that hold the wood together are gold.
The branding on the side is gold leafed into the wood.
It's fine, exquisite, we're talking top shelf BevMo-style, awesome dwarven wine.
-hide adra
-speak Marisha
Top shelf at BevMo!
-speak Matt
He pats it and he goes,
-speak Balgus
All yours.
If this doesn't get you in the door, I'll eat my shoe.
-speak Grog
Have you ever done that?
-speak Balgus
Maybe, I forget a lot of nights.
-speak Scanlan
Where might that door be?
-speak Balgus
Minute's up, you'll have to ask around, but it was great doing business with you.
-hide balgus
-speak Matt
He walks away from the table.
-speak Travis
I put it in the bag of holding.
-speak Matt
It does not fit in the bag of holding.
-speak Travis
What?!
-speak Matt
The barrel is too big, you barely got Dork the ox in there.
Which, for the record, they did fit a small ox in the bag of holding and then realized later on that there was no airflow.
-speak Travis
He came out!
-speak Taliesin
I feel like we weren't going to discuss that.
I felt that that was in the past.
-speak Matt
I felt that was a necessary story.
-speak Sam
Maybe if we drank some of it, it would fit.
-speak Laura
The troll dick.
Is that still in there or no?
-speak Travis
No, we actually got rid of the troll dick.
-speak Laura
Oh, okay.
-speak Taliesin
Did we trade the troll dick for something?
-speak Marisha
I thought we like used it as a weapon.
-speak Travis
I offered it up, but by that time it had turned into a slimy–
-speak Laura
Ew.
-speak Marisha
I thought we threw it at somebody.
-scene Discussing Next Steps

Can I stop Adra then and ask her where Greyspine Manor is? Keep, manor, whatever.

Ah, well I can have him show you.

-speak Matt
She pokes one of the barmaiders who turns around.
-hide adra
-continue
This one's younger, he looks like he's frazzled, maybe new here.
He goes:
-speak Dwarf
Okay, I can show you around, just follow me outside, come follow me.
-background kraghammer
-speak Matt
He walks out. He's got a little apron on.
He brings you to the edge of the outer walkway of the central ring you're on.
He points across the way and what you can see is a series of marble pillars that mark the outskirts of a residential district.
It's on the other side of the central ring of Kraghammer.
-speak Dwarf
If you go that way, you'll find the house of Greyspine.
It's the one that has black marble with gold veins.
The gate outside is wrought iron.
The real key point is, if you look on the front yard, you'll see a dwarven statue of the current Ironkeeper himself.
That's where you'll want to go.
-speak Scanlan
Yes, very helpful, young man.
-speak Vex
Thank you so much.
-speak Dwarf
Of course.
If you get the chance, you could fill out a little form saying how helpful I've been–
-speak Scanlan
Are there suggestion cards here?
-speak Keyleth
Oh, absolutely.
-speak Dwarf
Here.
-speak Matt
He pulls out a small parchment and hands it to you.
It's handwritten with a couple of checkboxes.
-speak Keyleth
Do you have one for each of us?
-speak Dwarf
I only have one.
-speak Keyleth
Oh, okay, that's fine.
-speak Dwarf
Sorry!
-speak Scanlan
Confidence needs improvement.
-speak Vex
Oh, it's okay, we have a wonderful writer.
-speak Percy
I'll rustle up a few.
That's fine, why not.
It's what I do, apparently.
-hide dwarfman1
-speak Matt
He runs back into the tavern.
-speak Sam
All right, shall we go to the manor?
-speak Laura
Do we want to do the manor right now? What time is it?
-speak Sam
5:00 or 6:00.
-speak Travis
We got to sleep.
-speak Laura
We might not want to bug him when he's, you know, having dinner.
-speak Travis
Let's be honest, that gate's going to jack us up.
It's going to be full of trouble.
-speak Sam
All right, yes, let's go sleep.
-speak Travis
Let's sleep.
-speak Laura
Well, it's only 6:00.
-speak Sam
Well, then we have time to do other things.
Is there any recon that's going to happen tonight?
-speak Laura
I think that Vax and I are going to go to Greyspine?
-speak Liam
We'll check out the house.
-speak Sam
Do you need any help?
-speak Liam
Sure, you can come with us.
-speak Sam
No, I don't want you to say yes.
-speak Laura
Then no, we'll stealth our way.
-speak Liam
Just a moment.
-speak Vax
Pike, you seem very distant.
It's very strange, are you all right?
-speak Vex
Pike's not listening, she's looking at the chat room.
-speak Scanlan
She's feeling ill.
Does she need to lie down?
-speak Matt
Pike is going along, she seems to be a little distracted, she can't quite understand.
-speak Pike
I don't know, I feel like I've been here before.
It's hard to explain.
-speak Grog
What?
-speak Pike
Anyway, I'm probably going to go rest for the evening.
-hide pike
-speak Matt
She heads back to the tavern.
-speak Travis
The fuck does that mean?
-speak Sam
We'll find out next week.
-scene To the Whorehouse
-speak Travis
But first, whores in the bedroom!
-speak Laura
Lovely.
-speak Sam
Grog and I go in search of a, shall we say politely, whorehouse.
-speak Matt
The polite term.
-speak Liam
Well, the cleric's away, the bard shall play.
-speak Grog
We need a massage.
On my crotch.
-speak Matt
Vex and Vax, you guys make your way to the Greyspine Manor, Grog and Scanlan head for the whorehouse.
-speak Sam
Is Grog going to find someone his size?
-speak Marisha
Percy and I spend some time making some really nice comment cards for–
-speak Taliesin
We're going to make some beautiful comment cards.
-speak Marisha
For what's his name?
-speak Matt
His name is Balan.
-speak Marisha
We're going to make some wonderful comment cards for Balan.
-speak Vax

Okay, so you'll get to that.

-speak Travis
The Stone's Pillow?
-speak Matt
The Stone's Pillow.
-speak Travis
I love it.
-speak Matt
It's an establishment of comfort and ease, and will run you both for the evening, as you are not Kraghammer locals, 30 gold for the night each.
-speak Travis
A bargain.
-speak Sam
We'll take it.
-speak Laura
30 gold?!
-speak Sam
What sort of ladies will we find there?
-speak Laura
Bearded ladies.
-speak Sam
What species?
-speak Matt
The madam of the house introduces you to a spectrum of ladies, mostly dwarven, and very attractive, you know.
This is a nice establishment.
There is one gnome.
One female gnome.
There are a number of male dwarves as well, that are standing at the ready.
There is one elf, looks a little shy and embarrassed that a goliath walked in.
-speak Sam
And that's our choice.
-speak Matt
Those are your choices.
-speak Travis
I'll take the tallest one.
-speak Sam
I'll take a dwarf.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You choose your lady, you take the tallest one which would probably be the elf.
As you walk in, the shy elf turns around entirely.
She is aggressive and throws you around.
You got your money's worth.
You get manhandled in a way that you haven't– You're going to be sore in the morning.
-speak Travis
Thank you!
-speak Matt
Welcome to Kraghammer, gentlemen.

-speak Matt
Are you just walking up to the manor?
-speak Laura
No, we're going to try to check out what it looks like.
See what the guards are like.
-speak Liam
Yeah, we'll pretend to take a stroll.
-speak Laura
Yes.
-speak Liam
Pose as a married couple.
-speak Laura
Ew, no.
-speak Liam
Just for the purposes of sneaking around the house.
-narrate
Laura fake pukes.
-speak Liam
I want to see what the area's like.
-speak Laura
How about we pose as brother and sister, creepy?
-speak Vax
You come on to every human, orc, and half-elf in the entire kingdom, but pretending to be my wife for 30 minutes is too much.
-speak Vex
Yes.
It's disgusting, so no.
-speak Vax
You're probably right.
-speak Matt
She's got standards.
-speak Liam
Okay.
So we'll take a stroll.
Shop, see what the area's like.
-speak Matt
You enter the residential district.
It is dark and you see the red stone that permeates the area for a low gentle glow of the entire city is now clustered into these street lamps.
You begin to press into the residential district proper.
There's some nice homes that are carved into the side of the rock, there's some stand-alone homes that are built out of fine stone.
You eventually make your way towards the nicer part of it, where you start seeing some of the more marble buildings, some of the more exotic stonework being used in the construction of the homes.

You also notice three of the guards that are part of the city establishment there are following you from behind, curiously.
The Carvers.
-speak Laura
Oh shit, the Carvers.
Shit.
-speak Matt
No weapons drawn, but definitely hands at the ready.
-speak Laura
Okay.
-speak Vax
Well, we could just keep walking.
-speak Vex
We could, but that could be bad.
-speak Vax
We just want to look at the house.
I mean we're not going to go sneaking in in the day.
-speak Vex
Let's very obviously point out which ones are pretty, so we look like we're just sightseeing.
-speak Vax
Yes.
-speak Matt
As you continue to walk, eventually some of the dwarves approach.
-speak Laura
I point.
-speak Vex
Oh! Look at that one, with the carving, it's amazing!
-speak Vax
The architecture is divine.
-speak Vex
Divine!

And then goes back to his normal voice.
-speak Matt
You get about 20 more feet before you get:
-speak Carver
Hail! Hail!
-speak Vex
Oh my! Yes?
-speak Carver
You foreigners are wandering too far in districts you don't belong to.
What's your business?
-speak Vex
Oh I'm so sorry, I was just so amazed by the architecture here.
I wanted to see the beautiful sculpture.
-speak Vax
We definitely are visitors here, sir, no one has explained the rules to your city.
We were just taking in the fantastic architecture and history of Kraghammer.
-speak Vex
We were told there was a beautiful sculpture down the street of the ruler of Kraghammer?
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion roll.
-speak Sam
Oh jesus.
-speak Travis
Oh god.
-speak Matt
Either of you, whichever you prefer.
-speak Sam
If only I was there.
-speak Laura
21.
-speak Travis
Wow! Pretty decent, good for you.
-speak Matt
The guards look at each other.
The one that was talking to you, you can see now, as he comes a little closer into the light, has this frazzled blond beard.
All wearing the same basic chest plate; long, red velvet cloak behind.
Each carrying some sort of heavy warhammer around the side of their belt.
Steps up and says:
-speak Carver
Well, just to tell you the rules here, if you're going to wander at night in a very expensive district, you don't want to do it by yourself because you have a good chance of  either being mugged or arrested.
We might have arrested you.
-speak Vex
Oh no! I'm so sorry! Well, do we need protection?
-speak Matt
One of them looks over and sees the bear that is off in the shadows nearby.
-speak Laura
I thought Trinket stayed behind.
Cool, cool!
-speak Matt
Trinket's quietly trying to keep up with his wonderful master.
-speak Vax
Come along Trinket, there there's nothing to be scared of.
-speak Carver
What's a bear doing in Kraghammer?!
-speak Matt
They all grab their warhammers.
-speak Vex
Oh no, please, he's quite harmless.
In fact, he's very scared of most people.
-speak Vax
He's completely trained.
He does tricks.
Doesn't he do tricks?
-speak Vex
He does.
Trinket show them your wonderful shake trick.
-speak Matt
At which point Trinket just shakes his whole body.
He looks at you, confused.
-speak Vex
That's good.
-speak Matt
Then raises a paw up.
-speak Vex
If you put your hand out, he'll shake your hand.
-narrate
Matt growls as Trinket.
-speak Vex
Yeah, see!
-speak Matt
The dwarves take a step back as the claw goes through the air.
-speak Carver
That's all right.
I would say if that's your animal–
-speak Vex
Yes?
-speak Carver
Don't bring it here.
-speak Vex
Oh, good to know.
Trinket, head back to that tavern, would you? People are getting nervous.
-narrate
Matt growls in agreement.
-speak Vex
I love you.
-speak Matt
Trinket begins to walk back.
A couple of other dwarves that are wandering past make a very wide berth around this armored bear.
What could possibly go wrong?
-speak Laura
He's so cute.
-speak Liam
He's a sweetheart, he's fine.
-speak Carver
Look, I'll show you to the statue and that's it, then you got to go.
-speak Vex
All right. Thank you.
-speak Carver
I don't see many half-elves here and honestly I'm excited to meet you, so let's do this quickly.
Come with me.
-speak Matt
He leads you further into the cityscape.
Down the road, you end up going through a few buildings.
You find one large wrought iron fence with a series of carved spikes towards the top, and you see the beautiful dark marble building with the gold trim.
-speak Vex
Oh, this one's amazing.
-speak Carver
This is what you were talking about, Greyspine Manor.
Lot of rich sons of bitches.
-speak Vex
Wow, so you said the Greyspines own this one?
-speak Carver
Aye.
-speak Vax
It's stunning.
We only heard about the building itself, what can you tell us about the people who live here?
-speak Carver
Bunch of rich sons of bitches.
-speak Vex
Well, we can tell that can't we?
-speak Carver
Actually, Ironkeeper's all right, he's been doing a great job.
The rest of the family can suck off.
-speak Vex
Oh, really?
-speak Vax
Not liked by the rest of the city, then?
-speak Carver
Oh, they have friends everywhere, but I personally don't like them.
They run business pretty dark.
They work most of their employees to the ground. To the bone.
-speak Vex
Oh no!
-speak Carver
I don't think that's how you run a business.
Well, that's how you run a business for profit, but not for–
-speak Vex
Wow.
It sounds like they would run the mithral mine which we've heard is so hard on its employees.
-speak Carver
Aye, that's the one.
-speak Vex
Oh, really?
-speak Carver
Yeah.
I don't know, I don't go that far south, doesn't interest me.
-speak Vax
Nor us.
-speak Carver
Smells like brimstone.
-speak Vex
I don't blame you.
-speak Vax
We prefer the company of good hard working people, like yourself.
We're very impressed with the work the Carvers do in this city, from what little we've seen so far, so hats off to you.
-speak Carver
I appreciate that. You know it's not easy.
You're born into it.
We spend most of our time training, which can get very boring.
-speak Matt
You see that two of the dwarves that are now about two steps behind go:
-speak Other Carver
All right, Thompson! We got to get back to our post!
-speak Thompson
Oh, sorry.
Look, we've dillied about too much.
Just follow us back, go about your business, don't wander here at night, and good luck.
-speak Vex
Thank you so much.
-speak Vax
Thank you.
-speak Liam
We follow for a couple of blocks, behind them for a bit.
-speak Laura

-speak Matt
Mm-hmm.
-speak Liam

-speak Matt

They bring you back towards the entrance of the residential district.
-speak Laura
Then we stealth and–

20.
-speak Laura
He rolled a 20, I rolled a 15.

That's okay!

Hey, hey, hey! I told you, it's dangerous down there in the dark! 
Don't do that!
-speak Vex
Of course!
-speak Thompson
Where's your friend?
-speak Vex
Oh, he already went back to the tavern that we're staying at.
I was wondering if maybe you could show me around the rest of the town?
-speak Matt
He looks to the other guards and they're obviously fed up with his flirting, and they're not too keen on you guys.
-speak Thompson
Well, you guys hold up post, I'll give her a quick walk around.
-speak Vex
Thank you so much.
-speak Carver
All right, but I'm going to tell the boss!
-speak Thompson
Fine! I don't get this chance very often!
-speak Liam
I wave off from the alley that I snuck in to.

Yeah, go do your shit.

Vax, you make your way through the alleyways, eventually back towards the building proper.
What would you like to do?
-speak Liam
Just going to watch, that's all.
Do I see any security details? See who's guarding the place.
-speak Matt
There are Carvers doing rounds around the city.
On the streets wandering through in pairs, keeping watch.
You don't see any particular guard outside, but you do see individuals moving past windows.
There's a little bit of light from the inside of the buildings.
-speak Liam
No Carvers or any sort of guard detail outside the house? Anything like that?
-speak Matt
Not between the gates.
The yard area and to the front door.
But you're hard pressed to find a moment where the street isn't visible to some Carver.
This area is pretty well guarded.
The Ironkeeper of the entire city of Kraghammer lives within that building, as well as one of the more powerful dwarven families, so it's pretty well watched.
-speak Liam
Okay, I'm going to head back to the inn, then.
I'm not going to poke the bear.

-speak Percy
We have comment cards, so this will all work out well.
-speak Keyleth
Yes! Here! Here you go, here you go–
-speak Scanlan
Success all around! Did you learn anything, Vex and Vax?
-speak Vax
I definitely think we should take the diplomacy route.
The place is heavily guarded.
There seem to be lots of Carvers.
-speak Matt
There's a knock at the room that you guys are currently talking in.
-speak Vex
Yes?

I come down too.
-speak Grog

Okay, as you guys head down, you can see now Balgus is now up and rubbing his chin.
-speak Balgus
Oh, never fought a bear before!
-speak Vex
No, Balgus! Fuck! Trinket, come here! 
Are we allowed to cuss? Trinket, come here!
-speak Matt
You are very much allowed to cuss.
-speak Laura
Okay.
-speak Matt
Isn't that right, guys? Fuck yeah!
-speak Laura
No, no, and I run into the ring with him.
-speak Matt
Okay, as you run into the ring a couple of the dwarves pat you on the back, you get a shove into the ring.
It's now Trinket and you–
-speak Vex
Oh! I'll take on this bear!
-speak Sam
What?!
-speak Taliesin
Well, all right!
-speak Matt
Make a general charisma check.
-speak Grog

-speak Liam
I'm pushing my way through the crowd.
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-speak Matt
What did you roll?
-speak Liam
A one.
-speak Marisha
Oh no!
-speak Matt
Yes!
-speak Liam
First one of the series, everybody! First one!
-speak Matt
Balgus sees this, and both eyes are open which means he's sobered up a bit.
-speak Balgus
Oh no! This bear's mine.
You want to fight two of us? Oh, it'll wake you right up!
-speak Vex
Let's do it!
-speak Balgus
Nothing as invigorating as a brawl!
-speak Scanlan
Are you going to fucking fight him?
-background cloudy
-speak Marisha
I cast a fog.
Over the ring.
-speak Matt
Okay.
As everyone is cheering up and getting ready, this very thick fog begins to fill the center of the bar area.
You can now see a bunch of people are like, wait, what the?!
Some are coughing.
Some are like, what the hell's going on? Fucking hell.
Why is there-
-speak Marisha
Okay, I run up in the fog, and I tap Trinket and I whisper in Trinket's ear and I say: 
-speak Keyleth
Trinket, I'm tapping you out.
-speak Marisha
And I turn into a bear like Trinket!
-speak Sam
What?!
-speak Travis
Good!
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Marisha
Wait.
First, I Polymorph Trinket into a squirrel.
-speak Laura
You can do that?
-speak Marisha
I can.
No, a mouse, like a rat.
-speak Laura
Little tiny.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You see shadows in the nearby fog, you hear:
-speak Balgus
Come at me, I'm going to–
-speak Matt
You can see Balgus's shadow swinging wildly at the air, angrily.
-speak Sam
Are you going to fight him?
-speak Laura
I don't know!
-speak Matt
You grab Trinket.
-hide trinket
-continue
Trinket shrinks down into a tiny little mouse.
-speak Keyleth
Scanlan! Catch Trinket!
-speak Sam
Jesus, I don't like rats, but I'll keep it.
Okay.
-speak Matt
Trinket, the little mouse face, the moment you see it, looks very confused, very scared.
-speak Sam
It's okay.
I'll protect it.
Don't worry.
-hide keyleth
-show cavebear 4
-refresh balgus
-speak Marisha
Then I bear form up.
-speak Matt
Boom, you wildshape into a bear form.
Now Keyleth is now this giant bear where Trinket once was.
-speak Grog
I got my money on Ballsack!
-speak Scanlan
Don't bet on the enemy!
-speak Liam
In the fog I somersault over some random dwarf and pull out my dagger.
But turn it around in my hand and whack Balgus in the back of the head as hard as I can, just to try and knock him out.
-speak Laura
Can you see in fog?
-speak Sam
He's a really good fighter.
-speak Liam
I have low light vision.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make a stealth check.
-speak Laura
What?!
-speak Matt
You have advantage because you are in fog.
-speak Laura
You have advantage, roll twice.
-speak Liam
Oh, thank you.
-speak Sam
Remember, he's our friend.
We don't want to kill him.
-speak Liam
21.
-speak Matt
Okay.
Balgus's drunken, mist covered state does not seem to notice your approach.
He is swinging wildly, though.
He has a disadvantaged attack on you as you approach.
One of his fists swings past you.
That is going to be a 12, I don't think that hits.
-speak Liam
No.
-speak Matt
You just narrowly dodge out of the way.
You can feel the fist just whoosh past one of your ears.
As you come back up, clutching the base of your dagger, go for your strike.
-speak Laura
Oh my gosh!
-speak Travis
Come on taint butter, you got it.
-speak Liam
Oh, that's no good.
Oh, I have advantage on the attack roll for this?
-speak Matt
Because he does not see you, yes.
You are currently stealthed.
-speak Liam
That's much better.
26!
-speak Travis
That'll work.
-speak Matt
That'll hit.
Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage on this, of course.
-speak Liam
Plus regular?
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Sam
Don't kill him!
-speak Matt
Well, we're considering it nonlethal damage because it's with the base of the dagger.
-speak Laura
I'm blindly looking for Trinket.
-speak Sam
Trinket's in my hands.
-speak Matt
You're like,
Where's Trinket?
You see a giant bear there and you're like,
There's Trinket! That's not Trinket.
There's no armor.
-speak Marisha
Oh, that's right.
-speak Matt
You're very confused.
Trinket now has no armor, is a slightly different shade–
-speak Marisha
No, he's close enough! 
Man, come on, I've been around Trinket enough.
-speak Liam
27 damage, right in the base of his skull.
-speak Sam
Jesus.
-speak Matt
Crack! A resounding impact hits.
A couple of dwarves hear it and are like, yeah! Ooh!
All the cheering stops and there's this lull.
Quiet hits.
Balgus hasn't moved, by the way.
You impact and it's like hitting a wall.
There's this taut, thick stump of muscle where the dwarf neck is.
-speak Liam
Fuck!
-speak Matt
As you pull back the dagger, his hand reaches up and grabs your wrist.
His head slowly turns towards you and he laughs.
-speak Liam
Bonus action to disengage.
Disengage as a rogue.
-speak Matt
Well he's going to attempt to grapple you.
-speak Liam
Oh no.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make an acrobatics check; it's probably your best score anyway.
-speak Liam
All right.
Oh, that's fine! That's a 30.
-speak Matt
That's a 30?
-speak Liam
Yeah.
-speak Matt
You manage to just slip out of his grip.
Barely.
He was about to clamp on.
As you step away, he turns towards you and goes:
-speak Balgus
Oh, well I feel alive tonight! 
Bring it, all of you! 
I want to smash a face in.
-speak Matt
He's got a little bit of ale froth at the corner of his mouth.
It's beginning to drip into his beard.
It's quite an awful sight for those that are close enough to see it.
The rest of you just see shapes and movement.
There's still this, "Okay, what's going on?" kind of feeling.

You hear Adra in the back going:

What are you doing, Keyleth?
-speak Marisha

-speak Matt
You're a bear.
-speak Laura
Do some tricks! Do some tricks! 
Start clapping and, like, dancing around.
-speak Marisha

I see her as my trainer.
-speak Laura

-speak Sam
I start playing music from my shawm instrument.
Which exists.
-speak Matt
Yeah, it does.
-speak Sam
A rousing jaunty bear-like tune.
-speak Laura
Yes!
-speak Matt
You begin singing your tune.
Do you give an inspiration dice to her?
-speak Sam
Sure, I would love to give her an inspiration dice.
-speak Matt
A d8 inspiration dice from the bard as you hear the enchanting, jaunty, bear dancing theme.
-speak Scanlan
~Oh, look over there! It's a bear! Yeah!~
-speak Matt
Bard getting his bard on.
Go ahead and make a performance check.
-speak Sam
Who, me?
-speak Matt
No, she does.
You're performing as a bear!
-speak Marisha
Natural 20!
-speak Matt
Do you want to add performance dice?
-speak Liam
Look at that, a fucking bear dance.
-speak Matt
I'm sorry, the inspiration dice that he gave you.
-speak Sam
No! It's a natural 20!
-speak Marisha
It's a natural 20!
-speak Matt
I know.
Okay!
-speak Marisha
No, I want to save it! I'm inspired, for later.
I will think back to that moment.
-speak Matt
You were so inspired, you weren't even inspired to be inspired for this.
-speak Marisha
Yeah!
-speak Matt
You actually manage to do a bear cartwheel, and slam into the ring, but it looks pretty cool.
You get back up.
You're on your hind legs, you dance on one foot for a second.
Balgus starts laughing, doubles over, clutching his stomach, laughing his ass off.
Other dwarves start laughing too.
The music gets louder and the band in the back of the tavern begins playing again.
There's now this general jovial air restored to the tavern.
-speak Laura
I grab an empty cup off of the table and say: 
-speak Vex
Tips for the bear, right here!
-speak Sam
We're going to get money for this?
-speak Travis
Of course.
-speak Liam
I beeline to the bar and say: 
-speak Vax
A large mug of ale, please.
-speak Liam
As soon as it's ready, bring it right over to Balgus.
-speak Matt
You have a hard time finding your way through the bar.
The people are at least now cheering, in the mood.
There's still some people trying to find their way to the front to see what's going because they hear the music and they hear the cheering.
They're pushing their way through.
Vax, you make your way to the bar.
You see Adra's really nervous.
-speak Vax
I can fix this!
-speak Adra
How? Do! Go!
-speak Vax
Quickly?
-speak Adra
Here, go!
-speak Matt
She hands you one, doesn't even charge you for it.
-speak Marisha
I'm still dancing!
-speak Liam
Looking for Balgus in the crowd.
-speak Matt
He's still in the center of the ring.
No one's still getting near Balgus.
They're cheering off to the side.
Balgus is laughing.
-speak Balgus
Ooh, growl for me! Do a happy growl!
-narrate
Marisha growls.
-speak Balgus
Yeah, there's a happy growl! Oh, it's been so long since I've been outside!
-speak Matt
A little tear on the edge of his face.
As you approach up his side–
-speak Liam
Arm around his shoulder.
-speak Matt
Immediately, instinctively, he slaps it off his arm and turns around.
-speak Vax
Take this! You are an impressive specimen, my good man.
I have never had a fight that amazing in at least a week.
That was something to see.
Here, take this, and after this one there's three more.
-speak Matt
He's drunk, you're offering him ale, and he's been laughing at a bear for two minutes.
Make a persuasion roll with advantage.
-speak Liam
Yeah! Persuasion, you say? 15.
-speak Matt
He looks at you with this big grin, and you can now see his gnarled, yellow dwarven teeth, this railroad of terror that his mouth is.
He reaches out, his beard poofing over the side, grabs it and goes:
-speak Balgus
See, now this is dwarven hospitality!
-speak Matt
He lifts his drink up and it spills a little bit on his arm.
He cheers. Everyone lifts up and cheers him back.
Everyone still keeps drinking through the fog.
It's like a bad sauna in here right now. Everyone's fighting their way through.
At which point now, Balgus slaps you on the shoulder, takes a drink, and wanders out of the fight ring, goes and finds a table to sit down and begin chugging what you gave him.
-speak Sam
Why don't we adjourn for the evening? Retire to our rooms?
-speak Travis
Why don't you go change out of bear form?
-hide cavebear

Well, each one of your rooms comfortably fits two people, maybe.
Like, one and a half?
-speak Laura
Oh no.
What will I do with Trinket?
-speak Matt
You, actually, have to bend through, Grog, to get into your room.
On the bed that you lie on, your legs dangle a good two feet off the bottom.
You could push Trinket through with a one, two, three! 
Or you can carry him through as a mouse, and then have him stuck in there.
-speak Marisha
How long can I keep him a mouse?
Up to an hour?
-speak Matt
I believe it is, yeah, concentration.
-speak Travis

Can I go downstairs and ask about stables? Maybe he can stay in the stables.

I'd say the room's probably a good 40 feet by 30 feet.
-speak Laura
Oh, so he's fine.
-speak Matt
Half of it's filled with barrels and crates, and storage of dried foods.
Trinket comes in, sniffing and starts rummaging into one of the half open sacks of dried meat.

Hello, everyone. Welcome back.
We've had our pee breaks. We've had our refills of our drinks.
Anyway, the party has taken their rest for the evening.
Once again, this is one of those weird experiences where you wake up, not because of the sun rising, because you can't see it in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, but eventually you all come to consciousness naturally.
What is your plan of action?
-speak Sam
Oh, Jesus, we should have all talked about this while we were all peeing.
-speak Travis
We're going to beat up everybody, right?
-speak Sam
Are we going to the manor?

The same guards are there who were there the previous night that encountered you guys so, as you roll up with an entourage-
-speak Sam
How many are there?
-speak Matt
Currently, there are 4.
-speak Travis
We can take them.
-speak Vex
Hi.
-speak Laura
I wave at Thompson.
-speak Matt
He's actually not there.
It's the two others that were with you.
He is noticeably absent.
-speak Laura
Oh.
-speak Vex
Where's Thompson?
-speak Matt
They look at each other and one of them is like,
-speak Carver
He's been given the day off.
-speak Vex
Oh, really?
-speak Carver
Well, what's your business, if I might ask again? You already seen the statue.
-speak Vex
Yeah, we saw the statue, but we wanted to get a better look at it.
We brought this gift for the Greyspines and we wanted to present it to them.
-speak Matt
The two new Carvers step forward and look at it.
-speak Carvers
Ooh!
-speak Vex
It's really nice.
-speak Matt
One of them's like:
-speak Carver
I'll tell you what.
If you let us taste a bit of that, we'll let you go.
-speak Laura
Is it sealed? Can we tell if it's sealed?
-speak Matt
You look at it.
It does not have any sort of port or exit on it.
It is just a solid barrel.
-speak Vex
If we open it, it'll ruin the barrel, right?
-speak Carver
Ah, that's right.
-speak Vex
Maybe we can save you a bottle of it when we open it inside.
We'll give it to you later.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion check for that.
It's a very persuasion based encounter.
-speak Laura
Should I roll that one that failed me earlier or my little dice?
-speak Matt
The little dice! They haven't come out yet!
-speak Laura
My little, tiny dice.
-speak Matt
Itty bitty dice.
-speak Laura
Teeny tiny dice.
Okay that's better, I rolled a 23.
-speak Matt
Okay.
They all look at each other.
-speak Carver
If you can save enough for all four of us, please do.
Bring it back, we'll be looking forward to it.
-speak Vex
We've got some bottles, don't worry.
-speak Carver
We'll be waiting.
If you don't show with the drink, we'll go right to our supervisor.
-speak Matt
They all nod.
-speak Vex
Yeah, keep nodding.
Here's the thing. I don't know if I can save four bottles worth, but I'll save as much as I can.
-speak Percy
Just say yes.
-speak Vex
Hey, I've got it covered.
-speak Vax
On our father's good name, we will bring you some of this.
That is a promise.
-speak Grog
It's a good name.
-speak Matt
They all look about each other.
-speak Carver
Fine. Remember, we're waiting.
-speak Matt
They all lick their lips a little.
-hide carver

-continue
They part and let you guys into the residential district.
You make your way to the very back.
You can see House Greyspine.
Once again, for those who haven't been there before, it's a beautiful arrangement.
The iron gate around it with spikes on the top.
You can see the entire front yard, it's about a good 80 yard walk to the front of the building itself.
That entire area is filled with various small sculptures and interesting knick knacks they've collected.
Put on display as a small museum as you approach House Greyspine.
You get to the large double oak door, which is about ten feet tall, four feet wide, and currently closed.
There is no handle on the door.
-speak Travis
No handle?
-speak Matt
No.
-speak Sam
Let's go knock on the door.
-speak Taliesin
I want to double check, see if there's a bell to ring or there seems to be some sort of calling–
-speak Matt
Easily enough, you see next to the door there is a small chain that protrudes from the stone wall.
It has a small bulbous ball at the end.
-speak Taliesin
Ding ding.
Ding-a-ding.
-speak Matt
You pull it.
Not a ding, but a clanging.
It is a heavier chain than you expected.
As you pull on it, you feel something large slamming into a brass-type material, as it echoes and resounds in the building.
Definitely announcing your presence.
-speak Keyleth
Percy, can I try?
-speak Percy
If you must, yes.
-speak Keyleth
Okay!
-narrate
Marisha mimes pulling on the chain.
-speak Matt
Boosh! It echoes into the house.
-speak Keyleth
I just wanted to do that once! I'm sorry.
-speak Scanlan
Should we ding-dong-ditch?
-speak Vax
Scanlan, perhaps a little ditty on strings will ease our introduction.
-speak Scanlan
I'll start singing a little jaunty welcoming song.
~Hello, hello, we're here to pay you calling.~
~Hello, hello I don't know what rhymes with calling.~
-speak Matt
All right, are you going to play the music for the sake of playing music?
-speak Sam
Yes, for now.
-speak Matt
All right.
About ten seconds pass before the door– you hear a large thud and one of the doors opens up.
-show magrim 4
-continue
You see a dwarf, with long gray hair that's slicked back and pulled into a ponytail.
A very small trimmed beard, very proper, steps out in long black robes and goes:
-speak Dwarf
Can I help you?
-speak Grog
Percy?
-speak Percy
Yes, Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.
-speak Vax
You can call him Percy.
-speak Percy
You can simply call me Percy, thank you.
We're here to discuss some business with Lord Greyspine and we have, of course, brought gifts and our charming company.
-speak Dwarf
Which lord are you looking for?
-speak Vex
Actually Nostoc.
-speak Dwarf
Nostoc, I'm afraid, is currently working at the quarry, if he's who you're looking for.
-speak Vex
Oh, of course he is.
-speak Scanlan
If Gradon is here, is that his name? Gradon?
-speak Matt
He gives you this look.
-speak Dwarf
Gradem is not taking visitors.
-speak Vex
Of course not.
-speak Percy
That's a shame, we brought this half-barrel of ale right here and some–
-speak Scanlan
And some very, very attractive mining contracts, but if there's no one here to talk about them–
-speak Dwarf
If you're talking mining contracts, you'll want to head to the quarry and talk to Lord Nostoc.
He's the one who runs the quarry.
As far as the Ironkeeper himself– I mean no offense, but only official political business.
-speak Percy
Well, this is definitely official political business.
I will also say, could you direct us to the quarry? 
We are new in town.
-speak Dwarf
Obviously.
-speak Percy
What was your name, again?
-speak Matt
The dwarf gives you a subtle look, goes:
-speak Magrim
My name is Magrim.
I am the servant of the Ironkeeper himself.
-speak Percy
Magrim, of course you're the servant.
You are filled with poise and sophistication, and of course, above all, protocol.
I would not wish you to break protocol which is why some simple directions, for those of us who are wishing to do some official business.
You'll be right on your way and your house will return to order.
-speak Magrim
Right.
The Ironkeeper is not open to business outside of pre-approved political understanding.
-speak Vex
Of course.
-speak Magrim
If you don't have a pre-approved meeting put within our ledger, you won't be seen.
-speak Vex
Of course not, but for the mining contracts, however, wouldn't we need to speak to Nostoc? 
Is there any way– I hear it's very hard to get down into the mines.
It's very well-guarded, right? That's why we came to speak to him here.
-speak Matt
He leans over and looks at the cask of ale and says:
-speak Magrim
To get down to the mines, you should go to one of the chain platform posts at the edge of town.
That cask should be enough to get Nostoc's attention.
The rest is up to you.
-speak Vex
Lovely.
Thank you so much.
-speak Scanlan
One moment, before we adjourn– 
Do we want to try to get into this place, or are we just going to go to the mines?
-speak Vex
Maybe we should talk to Nostoc first.
-speak Scanlan
And ditch this place?
-speak Percy
Every time we break into someone's house it turns out poorly.
-speak Vex
We're trying to get to the mines, essentially.
-speak Vax
I think he's still listening.
-speak Percy
Good man, good day.
We'll be on our way, thank you.
-speak Vex
Magrim, you've been wonderful.
Thank you so much.
We plan on keeping some of this ale and bringing it back to the household.
Would you like some when we open the cask?
-speak Matt
He looks down at the cask, looks up at you and says:
-speak Magrim
I would not turn down a sip or two.
-speak Vex
Lovely.
We'll be sure to save you a small bottle.
-hide scanlan
-speak Sam
I'm going to turn invisible.
-speak Matt
As he's looking over there, you vanish.
All right.
-speak Laura
You can do that?!
-speak Sam
And I'm sneaking into the house.
-speak Liam
To what end?!
-speak Travis
That's awesome! Who cares? Light it up!
-speak Sam
I don't know why!
-speak Travis
He's gone nuts!
-speak Taliesin
We are off the reservation.
-speak Magrim
Is that all your business?
-speak Vex
I believe it is all of our business.
-speak Magrim
Well, good day.

He steps back into the doorway and closes the large oak doors.

Scanlan, you are now standing in the foyer of Palace Greyspine.
A luxurious foyer, the floor itself is a fine dark velvet red carpet.
There are tapestries across the walls and small wooden end tables set at the edges of the hallway, this foyer area that contains sculptures and vases and plants that exist underground specifically.
There's a large stairway that leads up into the upper portion of the house and two doors at each side that lead to rooms you no longer can see.
-speak Laura
Let's all step away from the house.
-speak Matt
Magrim wipes his hands and walks away going:
-speak Magrim
Fucking foreigners.
-speak Sam
I follow him where he's going.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Sam
My nervousness, I let out a little bit of a fart as we–
-speak Matt
Make a stealth check.
-speak Sam
14 plus I'm invisible, plus two. 16.
-speak Matt
Because you're invisible, I'll give you advantage on that.
Go ahead and roll.
-speak Sam
Still 16.
-speak Matt
As you scamper by, behind Magrim, following him towards the kitchen area of the house.
Magrim stops and turns, rubs his stomach, and continues walking forward, seemingly unperturbed by the sound.
-hide magrim
-speak Sam
I'm snooping around, trying to see if there's any lords or higher ranking individuals in the area.
-speak Matt
Okay, I'll say within the time that you have within the house, you wander through quite a few rooms.
There's a wonderful music room, which contains a number of dwarven instruments that you've read of and many instruments that you know as well.
You actually find another, what do you call it again? A shawm?
You find another shawm within, more finely crafted than the one that you have.
-speak Sam
Oh fuck.
-speak Matt
A gift of lords, if you will.
-speak Sam
I'm so tempted, but no.
-speak Laura
Does he have an earring on? Does he have one of our earrings?
-speak Liam
We all do.
-speak Matt
Not everyone, you only made a few.
As you look about the household, you also come across a couple of bed chambers that are locked, pretty hefty lock.
-speak Sam
Not going to try.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You make your way up the stairway, and there's a long hall that leads to, essentially, a throne room that is still partially under construction, mostly finished.
It actually was an intentional build onto this house.
House Greyspine, when the current Ironkeeper went into office, it seems, began to have this room built.
It's nearly finished, but it's an extravagant room with a large stone and dark metal throne, steps lead up to it, and its raised dais-like pedestal in the center of the room.
A series of great magically glowing and flickering lanterns across them.
There are two dwarves inside that are currently finishing up the stone work.
They're doing various sorts of masonry and plastering in areas and carving out and chiselling out pieces of stone.
Other than that the room is currently empty.
-speak Sam
Shit.
There's nothing to steal!
-speak Travis
Drop a deuce in the bedroom!
-speak Matt
#gnomishdeuce.
-speak Laura
You totally should!
An invisible poo!
-speak Sam
I might as well try one of the doors that's locked, and see if I can pick it, but I'm not good at that, so I'll try.
-speak Matt
Do you have on your person any sort of thieves' tools?
-speak Sam
I have a forgery kit, a poisoner's kit–
-speak Marisha
Forge some thieves' tools real quick.
-speak Sam
Climbing gear? 
And a whip.
-speak Liam
Matt, I have one of the earrings, and I say: 
-speak Vax
Scanlan, what exactly is the purpose for this little escapade, and will it be ending shortly?
-speak Sam
Can I reply?
-speak Matt
You can, through the message-based ear enchantment.
-speak Scanlan
Just trust me, that I have no idea what I'm doing.
-speak Matt
Do you wish to pick one of the doors?
-speak Travis
Do it.
-speak Sam
Yeah, I'm going to try one!
-speak Matt
Okay, you have disadvantage on this.
-speak Sam
Of course I do.
-speak Matt
So roll twice, and we'll consider this a straight dexterity check.
-speak Sam
11, plus zero?
-speak Matt
You futz with the door for a good minute, trying to bend a piece of wire you had, and eventually get to a point where you hear a tink.
As the wire breaks.
-speak Sam
I can't do two spells at once, so I will give it up and I'll make my way to the door.
-speak Matt
Okay.
The door is currently closed.

You blink through this small, purplish arcane doorway.
It brings you directly outside.
You guys are waiting, Scanlan just pops into view.
-speak Scanlan
It was crazy in there! People were farting everywhere! It was not me.
They're building a throne room, there were some locked doors.
Man, I wish you could have been there! It was exciting, but ultimately pointless.
Let's go down to the mines!
-speak Vax
I would like to stress again that none of these dwarves are our enemies, at all.
We just want to go have some words with Greyspine.
-speak Grog
And we do not have our healer, at present.
-speak Vax
Well, we do, but she's very distracted, and is not feeling herself.
-speak Scanlan
She wanted to stay at the inn this morning.
-speak Liam
She's feeling awfully BAFTA today, so.
-scene The Greyspine Mines
-speak Scanlan
Let's make our way to the mines, shall we?
-speak Grog
To the mines, then, yeah.
-speak Matt
You make your way to the edge of the center ring.
You find that there are elevators that bring you to the bottom floor.
-show carver3 5
-show carver4 7
-continue
The elevators are chain based, like a ratchet-type system with two Carvers there, of course.
They catch your eyes.

-speak Matt
They nod, and let you pass.
-hide carver3

-continue
As you continue downward into the lower area, you can see the red stone that makes the atmospheric glow of Kraghammer is used less and less, and instead there are more torches.
The stone itself is either rarer the further down you go, or has less of an illuminating power the deeper into the earth.
You eventually reach the the lowest part of the city.
There's a number of large structures.
There is a giant domed temple that is made of gold and bronze in the center.
It looks almost like a massive gazebo, with closed off doorways on each side.
No guards though.
There is a large, heavy foundry far off to the left of you that has a little bit of smoke coming off of it, but most of the smoke is being filtered into a giant, metal funnel built into the rock.
Most of the smoke is funneled outside of the mountain.
You wander a bit and you can begin to see that part of the mountainside to the far right has that look of a strip mine.
Or like a lot of the minerals have been extracted, and is currently being mined further.
Probably one of the better places to begin looking for the Greyspine Quarry.
You eventually make your way to the outside of the quarry itself.
You look down into three large pits that descend deeply into the side of the mountain.
This mine has been going for quite some time. 
And the shallower parts are being cleaned up, prepped, almost like the mine is what's growing Kraghammer.
The more they mine into the mountain, the more they fill the mined area with further city construction.
It's this self perpetuating cycle of expanding the city downward.
At the edge of the quarry, there are a number of large stone dwarven buildings.
That largest one has the most guards around the base of it.
In the center of the quarry, towards the bottom, there are a number of tunnels.
Tunnels leading into the Cliffkeep Mountains proper, the mountains surrounding Kraghammer.
-speak Grog
Let's go where the guards are.
-speak Vex
Let's walk towards the guards.
-speak Vax
Let's just do this directly, I think.
-speak Scanlan
Just swords out.
-speak Marisha
Before we go up, I take the cask of ale and I grow some pretty flowers on it, and I make a nice pretty bow and I shine it up a little.
-speak Taliesin
You're making a fruit basket?
-speak Marisha
No, I'm just– it looks attractive now.
-speak Taliesin
It looks like a fruit basket.
-speak Marisha
It does not look like a fruit basket.
It's not that ostentatious.
-speak Taliesin
It's the Ale of the Month Club.
-speak Liam
In her defense, they probably don't see flowers too often.
It's a nice touch.
-speak Taliesin
That is very fair.
-speak Matt
You using your Druidcraft?
-speak Marisha
Exactly.
-speak Matt
The Prestidigitation for hippies.
Portions of the outside of this dark wood barrel begin to sprout, forming these entangled ivy vines.
With little buds of dark, ruddy flowers.
Something that would definitely appeal to a dwarven aesthetic.
-speak Marisha
That's hot.

-speak Laura
Can I use my perception to see which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest?
-speak Matt
Would be more of an insight.
-speak Laura
Insight! Which one of them looks most interested in our party.
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Laura
Oh, good.
I thought that was a one, but it's not.
It was a 13.
-speak Matt
13? Okay.
Strangely enough, they are fairly distracted.
Looks like it's been a rather long, uneventful morning, they're unfocused.
There are a few along the edges that look the most alert, and one of them is looking occasionally down into the quarry.
Just keeping an eye on the established area.
-speak Laura
Which one looks like the newest?
-speak Matt
The newest of the bunch would be the one that's on the far left that is looking down into the quarry as well.
He has a shaved head, has a small brownish beard that looks like he's starting to grow out into a nice, long tuft.
Maybe got shaved in the recent past as part of some college fraternity hazing.
-speak Travis
Dwarf Sigma Sigma.
-speak Matt
It's not quite there yet and he probably gets a lot of shit for it from the other dwarves.
He seems to generally be looking at you guys.
-speak Vax
Okay, work your magic.
-speak Grog
Yeah, do your thing– fuck these dwarves up.
-speak Scanlan
What are we trying to do?
-speak Vex
We brought this gift.
Hello! 
-speak Laura
We address all of them, maybe, right now, yes?
-speak Matt
The other guards reach back and grab their weapons.
One of them looking to you.
-speak Laura
I look over at the shaved-head one and I hold his gaze for a little bit.
-speak Liam
I give Vex a little push forward.
-speak Vex
Pardon me.
-speak Carver
All right, what's your business?
-speak Vex
Oh, yes, well– we are here to speak with Nostoc.
We brought a gift for him that's quite remarkable, actually.
-speak Matt
They curl up around the barrel that Grog's holding.
They look wary of Grog, but once they make note of the barrel they get all wide-eyed.
-speak Grog
Right? It's the shit.
-speak Carver
I've heard of that, but I've not seen anyone actually drink it.
It was only rumor that this even existed.
-speak Vex
It exists.
-speak Scanlan
And it's for Nostoc.
-speak Carver
This is a Balgus original?
-speak Vex
Yes.
-speak Carver
Signed by himself I see.
I'll go talk to Nostoc!
-hide carver3
-speak Matt
He heads inside of the building, the doors close behind him.
The other guards encroach, keeping a very keen eye, each one having a bead on the rest of your group.
About two minutes pass before he comes back, opens the door.
-show carver3 6
-speak Carver
Nostoc will see you briefly, but you best bring the gift.
I think that's what's holding his interest.
Inside, please.

You are led into the center of this building at the edge of the quarry, a series of long hallways.
There's this general smell of soot and ash and broken stone dust in the air.
A hint of brimstone-ish smell.
It's not very pleasant, it's very pungent for those of you who spend most of their time on the surface.
There is a general dust in the air, this general haze amongst the interior here.
It's definitely a work environment. You are led further down the hallway.
It curves to the left, and you're brought into a large dwarven study.
There are books on the walls, a series of ledgers and paper stacks on a large desk.

He's very clean cut, he has this intimidating dark glare.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Okay, you brought me a drink. You have my attention.
What brings you to the mines?
-speak Sam
We should have talked this through before.
-speak Percy
Well, several things actually.
Several things bring us to the mine.
My name, of course, is Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.
-speak Everyone
You can call him Percy!
-speak Matt
He raises a finger and goes:
-speak Lord Nostoc
You have not paid for your pleasantries yet.
-speak Vex
Oh, of course.
Grog, if you would.
-speak Vax
Tap that motherfucker!
-narrate
Travis mimes jamming a spigot or tap through the wood.
-speak Travis
I am assuming he had a goblet on the table.
-speak Matt
He pulls up a goblet from behind his desk.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Top it off! Thank you! 
Now put it on the side of the desk!
-speak Matt
Takes a long drag from the goblet before putting it down.
-speak Vex
Is it as amazing as we've heard?
-speak Lord Nostoc
It's pretty fucking good.
-speak Matt
He takes another long drag, while making sure you all watch him do this.
This goes on a little longer, the pageantry of him drinking this in front of you is definitely a power play.
Establishing some sort of unspoken dominance in the room.
Eventually he finishes his goblet, sets it down under the desk again.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Right, so where were we?
-speak Percy
We were here to call upon your expertise.
We imagine that we are not the first strangers to Kraghammer to come through–
-speak Vex
In the last few weeks.
-speak Percy
In the last few weeks.
We believe one of our compatriots had some dealings with you, perhaps not as pleasant as the dealings we are hoping to have.
-speak Scanlan
A lady, in fact.
-speak Vex
A halfling.
-speak Matt
At which point, as you say that, he gets this grin to his face.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Aye, I know of the one you speak.
-speak Vex
Yes.
-speak Lord Nostoc
She is a strong-headed one, that one.
-speak Percy
Yes.
-speak Lord Nostoc
She stepped on a few toes around this place.
You say you are compatriots of hers?
-speak Percy
We're here to mend any broken bridges, so to speak.
-speak Keyleth
Or broken toes, if you will.
-speak Lord Nostoc
She certainly left a mess in her wake.
There's that strange vision quest she kept talking about.
It brought her into portions of this city, portions of my business that she has no right trespassing on.
She went against Carver rules, she broke away from partial arrest and she went screaming down into our mines without my permission, blade drawn on some crazed suicide mission.
-speak Vex
You know what? We'll go after her.
We'll bring her out. We'll get her out of your mines.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Great. I'd like that actually.
-speak Percy
We'd also be happy to clear out anything unpleasant that we happen to find in there in the meantime.
-speak Vex
How much would this task be worth to you? Obviously we are doing you quite a favor and we brought you quite a gift!
-speak Scanlan
This cost us a thousand gold.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Obviously this lass means a lot to you, doesn't she?
-speak Vex
No, but I know she is probably wreaking havoc on your mines.
-speak Vax
We've come to correct the wrongs that she's done and come to bring her home.
-speak Keyleth
It also sounds like there are some other terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines.
-speak Lord Nostoc
There is nothing going on, we're fine.
We have everything under control, we don't need your help for that.
If you want to find your friend, go find her! If she is still alive.
If not, take her corpse back and leave.
-speak Percy
It's not help, sir.
We are simply respecting you as a businessman.
As a businessman I'm sure that you would disagree with unceremonious charity whether it would be to give it or receive it.
We are making sure that our dealings with you are fair and balanced.
-speak Lord Nostoc
I appreciate your offering.
You have bought your time.
Now, if you are here to go find your friend, I'll let you pass.
You may pass into the mine, but if at any moment you cross over to any sort of thieving bullshite–
I recommend that you fall down the same path your friend likely did and get killed real quick.
I don't take kindly to those who cross on my business.
-speak Percy
I doubt that we could find anything of more value that what we have already brought you.
-speak Vax
We are here to right wrongs and I promise you, our business is finding her and returning home.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Then go.
-speak Vex
Is that our business?
-speak Grog
Yeah, we are here to right wrongs and right lefts.
-speak Percy
And write comment cards.
-speak Keyleth
Wait, before we dive into this mountain– we know that there's ghouls and god knows what else down there.
Shouldn't we find out?
-speak Vex
Yes.
Do we have permission to enter within the next few days? Obviously we might need to be prepared.
-speak Lord Nostoc
I'll speak with the men.
They'll let you down. If you come back, good on you.
I think our business here is done.
-speak Percy
Yes.
-speak Matt
At which point, you hear muffled in the distance a loud ringing of a very loud bell.
He perks up a bit.
-speak Lord Nostoc
Our business here is done.
Please, shove off.
-speak Scanlan
Which way do we go?
-speak Matt
He looks over to the two other guards who are up front.
-speak Carver
This way.
-speak Liam
While he is talking I take a flask out of my cloak and approach the barrel and surreptitiously pour a little bit of it into the flask.
-speak Matt
Sleight of hand check.
-speak Sam
You're stealing beer?!
-speak Laura
Can I talk to good old Nostoc while he's doing that?
-speak Matt
He currently does not seem like the talkative type, you can certainly try.
-speak Liam
That's a natural 1 on my sleight of hand.
-speak Taliesin
I am going to make a fumble.
I am going to attempt to assist a sleight of hand with a bit of a fumble.
-speak Matt
He has already rolled it.
-speak Laura
Damn it.
I am going to fall down.
In front of Nostoc.
-speak Sam
Oh!
-speak Liam
13.
-speak Laura
I am going to fall down in front of Nostoc.
-speak Marisha
Come on!
-speak Taliesin
He is distracted by a bell.
-speak Matt
As you fill your flask–
-speak Travis
Shit.
Balls.
Ass.
-speak Matt
You hear him clear his throat loudly.
-speak Vex
Ow, oh my ankle! It hurts so very much.
-speak Matt
This is the first time you have witnessed the pristine, delicate yet well trained palm of a dwarven hand go straight to its forehead.
-speak Liam
I carry the flask up to his cup and refill it and say: 
-speak Vax
In my kingdom when a deal is set we drink together.
I would like, not much, but to pour us all a drink and agree, surely this cask is weeks' worth of drink–
-speak Nostoc
Get out of my office.
-speak Keyleth
Take the flask, take the flask.
-speak Vax
I can see it is a cultural difference, my apologies.
-speak Matt
A second and a third bell starts going off and the guards start leading you outside.

As you make your way outside the main building, you can now hear voices shouting, down in the quarry below.
-scene Something's Coming
-speak Laura
I lean down to one of the guards and say: 
-speak Vex
What is that bell for?
-speak Carver
Something is flushing out of the quarry.
-speak Vex
Flushing, what does that mean?
-speak Carver
We don't know.
-speak Matt
Some of the guards are motioning each other to follow.
Some of them start going down one of the paths to the quarry below.
-speak Carver
I don't know, we've had quite a few interesting things come through.
-speak Vex
Like what? Oh, like what?
-speak Matt
He swallows.
-speak Carver
Things I can't describe.
-speak Percy
Well, we can certainly help, lead on.
-speak Marisha
Is there anybody running out?
-speak Matt
Not yet.
As you head halfway down to the quarry, you begin seeing dwarves start running out of one of the tunnels.
-speak Marisha
I grab one of them.
-speak Matt
Well, they're quite a distance from you.
You're still walking down the side.
They're a good 100 feet from you.
They start running at you, you see blood streaking down one of their faces.
-speak Travis
Yes!
-speak Matt
They're charging out, one of them has a weapon and is limping.
And you start seeing small, green, scampering things rushing after them.
One, two, three, four, six, ten goblins come rushing out of the tunnel.
-speak Sam
Ah, I don't like these guys.
-speak Marisha
Don't you have family history with them?
-speak Vex
We should attack them! 
-speak Laura
I string my bow.
-speak Matt
Three dwarves are running out, one of them gets hacked down by one of the goblins.
It jumps on the dwarf and starts tearing into his neck.
-speak Taliesin
I take a shot.
Right now.
-speak Laura
I take a shot.
I shoot it!
-speak Matt
Okay, both you guys roll–
-speak Liam
I throw a dagger.
-speak Matt
You throw a dagger? Three of you, roll for attack.
-speak Taliesin
19.
-speak Laura
15.
-speak Liam
21.
-speak Matt
Okay, you guys you all hit from this distance because goblins are puny little things.
They're still a little small to see, but you're all pretty well trained and pretty honed with your aim.
You fire simultaneously, gunshot echo through the hallway, arrows, flying dagger, you see three goblins fall off a nearby dwarf who goes:
-speak Dwarf
Thank–
-speak Matt
At which point another goblin jumps out from behind and takes him out.
The guards stop running forward.
They start looking around and they see you pull out your weapons and they all take a step back and realize they don't want to die either.
-speak Carver
Well go, if you're going to help, go!
-speak Taliesin
We run straight in.
-speak Matt
With you guys charging in, you can now see a handful more goblins are rushing out.
They are like running really fast, sprinting.
-speak Marisha
I throw Entangle up, in the distance wherever they're coming from.
-speak Matt
Okay, what's the radius on that?
-speak Marisha
Like a hundred feet.
-speak Matt
That's the range.
What is the radius?
-speak Marisha
Oh, 20-foot radius.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You find a portion of the central point where the things exit from the tunnel and these strange reddish vines begin to protrude and to begin to grab nearby goblins and pull them up in this massive, weird vine creature.
You hear stomping and you now see two larger ogre-like creatures come storming out.
-speak Marisha
Oh, shit!

You now see Scanlan, who's usually a jovial individual, his eyes begin to tense with fury.
-speak Scanlan

-speak Scanlan
No, but they will all die.
Don't spare any of them.

Top of the round, Percy you're up.
-speak Taliesin
I'm sitting down and I'm busting out Bad News. 
-speak Marisha
Bust out Bad News!
-speak Matt
Percy stops just as he gets to the quarry, and he pulls out from a small sack on his back this large elongated contraption.
This weird construction that looks similar to the pepperbox he usually carries, but much larger and cumbersome.
He sets it up on the ground with a small stand at the front and preps itself with a visual point.

Nope, first time.

-speak Taliesin
That's a 30 attack.

Go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Marisha

-speak Taliesin

-speak Matt
Natural 19?
-speak Taliesin
Natural 19.
-speak Matt
Yeah, that should critical for you.
-speak Taliesin
That does critical for me.
I've never criticaled with this either.
What does that mean?
-speak Matt
That means the damage dice you double.
Roll for damage, double that, and add your modifier after that.
-speak Marisha
Come on! Big money, no whammies.
Yeah! Hell yeah!
-speak Taliesin
27 points of damage.
-speak Travis
Get after it, big man!
-speak Marisha
Is that doubled?
-speak Taliesin
That's doubled.
-speak Matt
You guys hear this cacophonous blasting sound, a flash of blue energy and sparks shoot out the back of the weapon.
It actually lifts Percy off the ground for a second and he shifts himself from the sheer blast.
This streaking, heated bullet, white hot, goes cascading through the air.
Plunges into the side of the ogre's shoulder with a smattering of blood splattering against the cave behind it.
It's actually moved back a step and has to catch itself.
Slams its club into the ground.
That ends your turn?
-speak Taliesin
I can't do anything after that.
That's just reload.
Bad news travels far and fast.

Nothing travels faster.

You pull out your arrow and as you pull it back, a little bit of energy courses through your fingers, strikes through your arrow.
You can now see this crackling energy as you're pulling it taut in your bow.
You let it loose, roll for attack.
-speak Laura
Okay! 21!
-speak Matt
21 hits.
You do the damage of the arrow plus the damage of the spell.
-speak Laura
Holy moly! So that's this.
13 for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell.
17 damage!
-speak Matt
The ogre grabs its club, trying to recover from the bullet it just got to the shoulder, as the Lightning Arrow slams into its chest.
It looks down for a second, and then the charge pulses through its entire torso.
It screams out into the cavern, its whole muscle system locks tight and it falls forward, onto its chest.

You're dealing with the fact that you just fired your gun for the first time and it burned your hands a little.
Grog is familiar with one thing, fear in the eyes of his enemies.
Looking at these goblins, they're not charging to attack.
The attacks seem to be instinctual.
They are running.
-speak Marisha
Oh, no!
-speak Matt
They are scared.
-speak Laura
Yes!

They are fleeing from something.

Organs spill out, intestines, and it looks down and tries to pull them back in.
You see the color draining from its face, and you lean up and kick it down.

You can add it to an attack roll, a saving throw.

As it breaks through the stone, all the heads rear back.
-speak Marisha
Do naga heads do something if you look at them?
-speak Matt
We're beginning back at the top of the initiative order.
-speak Travis
Oh shit!
-speak Laura
Wait! I got a question! My Hunter's Mark, can I transfer it to that thing or do I have to–
-speak Matt
Correct, you can, yes.
Because this still part of the encounter.

Sweet!

Percy, you're up first.
-speak Taliesin
Do I have to take new aim or can I have myself already trained on–
-speak Matt
You've had a moment to train.
You haven't seen the creature until it just burst out, so it would take you a round to aim.
-speak Taliesin
I'm taking my round to aim.
-speak Matt
Okay, so you're aiming.

Oh! Me! Okay, I'm going to shoot–
-speak Matt
What did you roll for stealth, by the way?
-speak Laura
20.
-speak Matt
Then yeah, he has no idea you're there.
-speak Laura
Sweet!
-speak Matt
He sees the bear growling.
-speak Laura
Trinket is just hanging out.
I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage.
-addgraphicon target target infront shadow naga vex
-updatebattle
-continue
No, I'm just going to shoot him twice.
-speak Matt
All right, go for it!
Arrow one, arrow two, Legolas style.
-speak Laura
I am going to use my blazing bowstring also.
21 to hit.
-speak Matt
21 hits!
-speak Laura
11 damage, plus 7 fire damage.
-speak Matt
One of the serpent heads reels back from the pain.
It begins biting at where the arrow's now protruding from it, trying to break it off.
-speak Laura
Then I'm going to roll again! That's a 24!
-speak Matt
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Laura
14 damage.
-speak Matt
Both arrows sink into it.
Definitely piercing through the scales a little bit, but not sticking too deeply into its body.
It's definitely a hearty creature.

-continue
I would like to use the chain of returning, attach it to the end of the greataxe, and throw it from where I am at the snake.
-speak Matt
Grog comes running around, rears back, and takes his double-handed great axe and lobs it overhand.
The chain wrapped around your wrist, keeping it attached to you.
Go ahead and roll for the attack.
-speak Travis
17!
-speak Matt
Just hits.
-speak Travis
All right, nice.
That is 15 damage.
-speak Matt
The axe embeds itself pretty deeply into the torso.
-speak Laura
Oh! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark.
-speak Matt
Roll Hunter's Mark damage right now.
-speak Laura
Thank you, chatroom!
6 damage!
-speak Travis
This says,
An athletics-strength check is required to pull the weapon free, DC 12?
-speak Matt
Go ahead and roll an athletics check.
-speak Travis
Shit.
Balls.
Taint.
5.
-speak Matt
Plus–
-speak Travis
Plus what?
-speak Matt
Plus your athletics!
-speak Travis
Oh! That's bound to be good.
Plus 7! It's 12!
-speak Matt
12 is the DC! So yeah!
You pull back the chain and as you do, the blade is resisting, it's stuck in the torso.
And then it actually flies out violently, and you barely catch it.
-speak Grog
Meant to do that! Meant to do that of course.
-removeallgraphics
-addgraphicon turn turn behind noshadow naga naga

-speak Matt
Now it's its turn.
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-speak Travis
Yeah, come on!
-movetoken naga 14 -1
-updatebattle
-speak Matt
For its size, when it moves, it moves in a burst of lightning energy.
It's too fast for its corpulent form.
-addgraphicon bite bite infront shadow keyleth naga
-updatebattle
-continue
As it goes behind to Keyleth, it makes an attack with each of its 5 heads.
Remember, you have Stoneskin, so I believe you have resistance against damage, right?
-speak Marisha
Oh yes, I do.
-speak Matt
It's a natural 20.
-speak Everyone
Oh no!
-speak Matt
That's a 12 plus seven, that's going to be a 19 to hit?
-speak Marisha
Yeah.
-speak Matt
10 total will miss.
Natural 20 again.
-speak Marisha
What the fuck!
-speak Matt
And a 12 will miss.
Two critical hits, and a hit on you.
-speak Travis
What is this bullshit?
-speak Marisha
I'm glad I cast Stoneskin.
-speak Matt
I know.
So you take half damage for these.
Which is fine.
-speak Marisha
Yeah.
-speak Matt
12 damage halved to 6.
-speak Laura
That's nothing!
-speak Matt
Not too bad.
7 damage from the second strike, halved to 4.
And another 12 damage halved to 6 from the 3rd strike.
However, make a constitution saving throw.
As venom from the fangs of the naga begin to pulse into your bloodstream.
-speak Marisha
I should have taken the poison resistance.
Fuck!
Natural 1!
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-speak Marisha
It's a bad day.
-speak Matt
You feel this burning pain pulse into your bloodstream, as your whole body doubles over from the pain.
-speak Sam
Keyleth dies in episode one.
-speak Matt
You suffer 31 points of poison damage.
-speak Travis
Are you okay?
-speak Matt
The poison damage is not halved because it is not a physical attack on your body.
-speak Laura
Is Keyleth unconscious?
-speak Sam
No, she's okay.
-speak Marisha
Took me down to 16 hit points.
-removeallgraphics

-speak Liam
Okay, I start jogging down.
-addgraphicon dagger dagger infront shadow naga vax
-updatebattle
-continue
Throwing a dagger with advantage from stealth is a natural 19, which is a critical for me.
Oh, yeah.
The other one is a 26.
-speak Matt
That also hits.
You chuck both daggers out, they both arc around.
-speak Liam
44 damage on the critical.
-speak Travis
Damn!
-speak Matt
Rogues, man.
-speak Keyleth
Help me. Help!
-speak Laura
That's just one dagger?
-speak Liam
That's just one.
6 damage on the second dagger.
-speak Matt
The first one goes straight into one of its eye sockets.
It's looking pretty rough, actually.
The stitches beginning to come apart at some of the seams and you can see a black ichorous liquid spill out from some of the suture marks.
-speak Liam
Just a reminder that the daggers, folks, blink back to the belt on my waist.
-speak Matt
Because magic.
Magic rogue shit.

Out of anger I take my staff and I crack it down and do Thunderwave.
Pushing him back 15 feet.
-speak Matt
He makes the saving throw.
-movetoken naga 2 2
-updatebattle

He gets pushed back, so he takes damage, just half damage.
As Percy is setting up his gun it gets slammed towards him.

It takes 4 damage.

That's my turn.

-speak Sam
Can I bonus inspire myself?
-speak Matt
Because you're Scanlan I'll say, yes.
You have such a high opinion of yourself that even you could inspire yourself.
So yes, why not.
-speak Scanlan
~It would help me to acquire some dice to inspire.~
-movetoken scanlan 1 0
-updatebattle
-speak Sam
I inspire myself first and move five feet back so I'm on the same row as him.
Them I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at him.
-addgraphicon lightning lightning infront shadow naga scanlan
-continue
Straight line, that way.
-speak Matt
You don't have to roll to hit.
You just roll damage on that.
I make a saving throw.
-speak Sam
Oh! I didn't even need to inspire.
-speak Matt
What's your DC on the spell? Top of your spell list.
-speak Sam
17.
-speak Matt
17? That's a failure on its saving throw.
Go ahead and roll 8d6.
-speak Laura
8d6?! Kill him!
-speak Matt
Bards.
Gets spells from other classes.
-speak Travis
If you kill, I will take a shit on this table.
-speak Liam
It's gone.
-speak Sam

-speak Sam
I've never killed anything before!
-speak Travis
Never killed anything in two years!
-speak Liam
For the people at home, we live to hear Matt say:
-speak Everyone
How do you want to do this?
-speak Matt
I let the player describe their victory.
As you sing to yourself to bolster your arcane energy, you release a bolt of energy.
How do you want to do this?
-speak Sam
The bolt of lightning begins in its tail and works its way up through its spine.
Slowly but painfully torturing it as it slowly, slowly feels the effect coursing through its evil body.
-speak Matt
A lightning bolt should be an instant flash of arcane energy, but using your bardic ability to shape sound, you actually cause it to crawl.
You control it as it begins to cascade up the torso of this horrible abomination.
As it does you can see the bolts splinter and destroy each suture wound as each of its heads begins to slough off the rest of the torso until nothing is left but the single head screaming into the air.
As the bolt makes its way up the neck, its eyes burst out in a blast of energy.
The body falls limp to the ground.
-speak Sam
Can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an S?
-speak Matt
A Scanlan-shaped lightning bolt is burned into the torso of the strange naga beast.
-speak Grog
Well done, Scanlan, well done!

The dust settles, the adrenaline still pumping in your system, Scanlan.
All the rest of the dwarves begin stepping down, putting their crossbows down, looking down at the little gnome that created a storm from its hands.
One of them pats him on the shoulder and goes:
-speak Carver
Well done.
-speak Scanlan
Thank you.
Just promise me you'll that tell Pike about this.
-speak Carver
Okay?
-speak Scanlan
Because it was really cool, right?
-speak Carver
That was pretty cool.
-speak Scanlan
Okay, good.
-speak Matt
All the dwarves look into the tunnel that it came from and the one that you spoke to earlier goes:
-speak Carver
So that's the kind of thing that's been coming out of there.
-speak Vex
Lovely.
-speak Keyleth
Thanks for the heads up.
-speak Percy
That was really helpful.
-speak Matt
We'll go ahead and leave the game there for the night.

Folks, well done.
Hope you guys had fun watching our first ever Critical Role.
That was a good time so we'll be here next week on Thursday.
