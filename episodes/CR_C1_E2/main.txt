-scene After the Battle
-speak Matt
Hello everyone, and welcome to the second episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us crazy voice actor, nerdy types sit here and play Dungeons and Dragons.
Let's get this party started.
All of you are still riding the adrenaline of the battle.
Scanlan feeling the tingling in his fingers, the arcane energy is still sparking.
The rest of the nearby Carvers slowly converge in and begin to walk up to the party.
And someone starts:
-speak Carver
That was great, that was well done!
Fantastic! Where'd you learn that?
-speak Matt
One of them comes up there, 
-speak Carver
Ah, I could've done better than that.
-speak Matt
And they start just shouting off at each other and patting each other on the back.
This lasts for a while before, all of a sudden, a hush comes over the crowd.
-show nostoc 2.5
-continue
And you see Lord Nostoc Greyspine himself stepping through.
He looks at the rest of the group and goes:
-speak Nostoc
All right, so you've certainly proven yourselves in battle.
I would like to continue this conversation that we had back in my office if you don't mind.
-hide nostoc
-speak Keyleth
Oh wait, Nostoc.
-speak Matt
He's not even listening, he's just walking off.
-speak Keyleth
Yeah, mmm.
-speak Laura
Are you still an eagle?
Can you even talk to him?
-speak Taliesin
Shouldn't you just go caw?
-speak Marisha
Well I'm not an eagle.
But I am still poisoned.
-speak Laura
Oh, I can help you.
-speak Marisha
That'd be great.
-speak Laura
Yeah! Hold on, I'm gonna go up, and I'm gonna cast--
-speak Sam
Cast? You can cast?
-speak Laura
I can. I've got plenty o' spells.
-speak Liam
You can kill?
-speak Sam
All right, fair enough.
-speak Laura
I'm gonna cast Protection from Poison on Keyleth.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make a constitution saving throw with advantage.
-speak Marisha
13.
-speak Matt
That's enough. 
As Vex casts the spell, you feel the rest of the poison leave your body. 
It feels like you kind of get your breath back.
The rest of the Carvers kind of look about, awkwardly staring back at Nostoc as he walks off.
Kind of looking at you, waiting for you to follow. 
-speak Scanlan
Yeah, I guess we should go follow him.
-speak Percy
We have two very important questions.
-speak Grog
Can't we look in the hole a little bit more?
-speak Vex
We're gonna go in the hole in just a minute, Grog.
-speak Scanlan
Then you can smash, you'll be fine.
-speak Grog
You promise?
-speak Vax
You did that last night.
We need to take care of business.
Let's go talk to the man. I'm sure it's going to lead back to the mines.
-speak Keyleth
To the hole.
-speak Vax
Yes, to the hole. Everything's back to the hole.
-speak Scanlan
Percy, do you have something to say before we go?
-speak Percy
Well, this is good.
We have to find out what that was.
And we have to see if he'll finally give us some of that ale.
I think are the two most important things.
-speak Vex
It was wine, I believe.
-speak Scanlan
No, it was bloody, bloody beer.
-speak Vex
Blood wine?
-speak Grog
Beerwine.
-speak Matt
It was delicious is what it was.
-speak Travis
It was really good.
-speak Laura
Let's go talk to Nostoc.
-speak Sam
Let's follow him, let's follow him.

-scene Nostoc
-speak Matt
You head back up the ramp from the mine to the upper area.
-background bricks
-show nostoc 4
-continue
You are brought into the building again, brought back to Nostoc's office.
He's not sitting, he's kind of pacing behind his desk, waiting for you as you approach.
As you enter the room, he stops pacing, turns around, puts his hand on the desk.
-speak Nostoc
Please, enter and close the doors behind you.
-speak Scanlan
Sir Greyspine.
Lord Greyspine?
Mr. Greyspine?
-speak Nostoc
Lord Greyspine is fine.
-speak Scanlan
Lord Greyspine, yes.
Why have you summoned us here?
Is it to tell us information about what just came out of your mine, I hope.
-speak Nostoc
Well let's be clear.
We dwarves don't need help from outsiders.
We can handle our own business just fine.
-speak Vex
Of course.
-speak Nostoc
You see these small intrusions have been bad for meeting our quotas with the Bronzegrip metal warehouse and export shipments.
Employees have been forced to collapse a non-negotiable portion of our tunnels to prevent incursions like this.
Without my approval.
And this is a pattern I wish to stop at once.
Thus, I have a proposition for you.
Now, I will give you free reign to enter our mines.
I'll make sure no Carvers bother you as you wander the city's lower ring.
And I will contract you to delve past our tunnels and investigate the source of these creatures.
Where they come from, where they live, and if there is some sort of a leader who gives them their commands.
Eliminate them.
For this, I will reward you with not a trifle sum.
25,000 gold pieces.
Plus 250 gold per beast scalp you provide upon returning.
-speak Vex
Ooh, I like this.
-speak Scanlan
Money is wonderful. We like money.
But we've been charged to find Lady Kima.
We need assurances that we will find her or at least some evidence of her in the mines.
-speak Nostoc
The brazen halfling bitch went in there without my approval and we haven't seen her since.
So if she is down there, I hope she's in one piece.
I can't guarantee it.
But if there's any place to find her, that's probably it.
-speak Vax
We're the group of adventurers for you.
I don't know if you've heard of the heroes of Emon, who just recently- 
I'm sure you've heard something.
Word travels fast.
-speak Nostoc
Not beneath this mountain, it doesn't, not of human business.
-speak Vax
We've just done a lot of good for the ruler of Emon.
-speak Nostoc
Great.
How does that help us dwarves?
-speak Vex
Well, we've discovered, in our past adventures, that every realm seems to be having trouble with the same sort of creatures, coming up from the Underdark perhaps?
-speak Vax
All we're saying is, help us help you.
What exactly have you seen before this day?
More of the same? Or other creatures?
-speak Matt
He sits back for a second.
-speak Nostoc
The types of creatures, I do not know.
I mostly deal with the business and just know that there's some bullshite going on down in the mines.
You could ask our foreman, Hieris.
He's dealt with the cleanup each time we've had an incursion like this.
So if anyone has information on what these creatures are, he'd be the one to talk to.
-speak Vex
All right.
-speak Percy
I think this seems like the sort of job we'd want to take.
-speak Grog
Will we get paid for the monsters and creatures we've already slayed?
-speak Nostoc
This deal was not sewn in yet, so no.
-speak Grog
Oh.
-speak Nostoc
But we thank you for your aid.
-speak Percy
It is customary in our culture to seal a deal with a drink.
As I think you are aware.
-speak Vex
Truly, truly.
-speak Vax
See, I wasn't just fucking with you last time.
-speak Travis
Ha! I forgot you did that.
-speak Vax
That's a thing we do.
-speak Percy
And since we are about to risk our lives...
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion roll.
-speak Taliesin
Yes! Happily.
-speak Travis
Roll good, it's the first one.
-speak Liam
Come on, Percy!
-speak Taliesin
14.
-speak Sam
It's pretty good. Not great.
-speak Matt
You can see this long, distant, angry, dwarven, mistrusting stare.
Rubs his chin, his well-kept, red beard and goes:
-speak Nostoc
But a sip, as it was a gift.
-speak Vex
Yes!
-speak Scanlan
We'll take it.
-speak Matt
He pulls the ale barrel you guys provided, sets it on the side of his desk.
It still has the spigot from earlier.
-speak Nostoc
Take a bit.
A bit.
-narrate
Laura whispers.
-speak Vex
Put some in a bottle.
-speak Vax
Let me take care of it.
-speak Liam
I'll pour everyone a glass.
I take my empty water flask that I emptied out before, and smile and pour glasses.
And also squirting a little bit into it as I go.
-speak Sam
I start to just play a little ditty on the flute.
-speak Scanlan
I thought we could accompany our sip with a little bit of music, not to distract you, just to-
Just to sort of accompany us.
-speak Matt
His nose squints at the sound.
-speak Nostoc
Gnomish tunes aren't to my ears and liking.
-speak Matt
All right, so go ahead and make a sleight of hand check on this.
-speak Liam
Okay. This is what I do.
-speak Laura
Roll well. Here we go.
-speak Liam
Oh, no.
-speak Sam
You have inspiration dice.
-speak Liam
Oh good. Now I'm at 19.
-narrate
Travis groans in relief.
-speak Matt
He's listening to the gnomish music and kind of pushing it away with his hands, like, 
-speak Nostoc
Stop, I don't- no.
I appreciate it, but I don't.
-speak Scanlan
All right, there's not accounting for taste.
-speak Matt
As you do that, your wineskin goes to full.
You switch over to one of the cups, you pass around the drinks.
All of you manage to get your drinks passed around.
-speak Vex
Huzzah!
-speak Nostoc
To a contract!
-speak Grog
Aye! Huzzah!
-speak Percy
To a contract.
-speak Scanlan
L'chaim!
-speak Keyleth
Contracts.
Love contracts.
-speak Vax
Is that Dwarvish?
-speak Scanlan
It's Gnomish.
-speak Percy
To risking our lives. For money.
-speak Laura
How old is Nostoc?
Just out of curiosity.
-speak Matt
It's hard to tell.
Dwarves live quite a long time.
He would be equivalent to like a human forties.
Dwarven time, somewhere in his mid-hundreds.
-speak Keyleth
Smells like its been in the barrel for a hundred years.
-speak Vex
This is excellent.
-speak Vax
Tastes like two buck Chuck.
-speak Grog
What do you know of a Ballsac up in the tavern?
-speak Nostoc
I'm sorry, what?
-speak Grog
Do I have that right?
-speak Vex
Ball, ball-
-speak Keyleth
Balgus.
-speak Grog
Balgus.
-speak Nostoc
Ah, Balgus, that's the brand of what you brought me.
-speak Scanlan
You know what, I think we asked about him last time.
-speak Vex
I think we did.
-scene Short Rest
-speak Marisha
Is this considered a short rest?
-hide nostoc
-background kraghammer
-speak Matt
If you'd like to do that, that would just be taking a short rest outside, probably not in the office proper.
-speak Laura
Understandable.
When we take a rest, can I look for Hieris?
-speak Matt
Definitely.
So, while you guys are taking a short rest, you're able to use any of your hit dice to heal up naturally.
-speak Sam
I will sing a song of rest.
And it goes a little something like:
-speak Scanlan
~Scanlan make you feel good~
~Scanlan make you feel real good~
-speak Sam
You get an extra d6 healing.
-speak Travis
I appreciate the slow jam.
-speak Laura
I didn't take any damage. I'm at full health.
-speak Matt
So you got a slow jam just for the sake of the slow jam.
-speak Laura
That's right. And it was great.
-speak Matt
All right, roll an investigation check.
-speak Laura
Oh, 25.
-speak Matt
A brief discussion with a few of the other miners, around the outskirts of the buildings.
Eventually it leads you over to a small, secondary building.
That apparently is where Hieris resides and keeps watch over the entire establishment.
-speak Liam
I've tagged along.
-speak Laura
Knock knock knock.
-speak Matt
All right, the rest of you going with her?
-speak Sam
Yeah, we'll go with her.
-speak Matt
Why not! Why split the party?
-scene Hieris
-continue
So the group makes their way over to the outskirts of the building.
-show hieris 4
-continue
Opens up and a very nice, portly looking dwarf with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard.
Big reddish, ruddy nose. Leather apron on.
And he opens the door.
-speak Hieris
Aye, hello! Nice to meet you.
What can I do for ye?
-speak Vex
Hi. You must be Hieris?
-speak Hieris
I am, I am.
Foreman of this here fine mine.
-speak Vex
Wonderful to meet you.
I've heard wonderful things about you.
-speak Hieris
Oh, have you! From who?
-speak Vex
Uh, from Lord Greyspine himself.
-speak Hieris
Really?
Oh. All right.
Well, how can I be of service?
-speak Vex
We were curious.
I'm sure you witnessed all of those wonderful goblins and trolls and other nonsense coming out of the mine.
-speak Hieris
Aye. Nasty lot.
It always makes my weeks that much more interesting.
-speak Vex
Weeks?
So this has been happening for quite a while?
-speak Hieris
Unfortunately, at least five or six.
-speak Vex
And what kind of monsters have you been dealing with?
-speak Hieris
Terrible kinds.
-speak Matt
He starts rubbing his chin for a little and goes:
-speak Hieris
We generally deal with the occasional goblin den that we stumble across when opening new tunnels. 
That's part of the norm. 
Other nasty underground beasties. 
However, over this past few weeks, we've seen some real nightmarish things slither out of the shadows. 
Slimes and oozes that would mutate and change color rapidly before seeming to dissolve on their own.
Unstable-looking really, in their form.
Many goblins stitched together, like some kind of ball of screaming green lint. 
-speak Scanlan
Like a goblin centipede?
-speak Hieris
If you will, aye aye.
-speak Scanlan
Sounds like some type of necromancy magic.
-speak Hieris
Perhaps, but they're not undead, per se.
They're still alive. At least from what we can tell.
-speak Scanlan
Oh, that's even worse.
-speak Hieris
We even had one brief run-in with what looked like a duergar that had sprouted eyes and mouths all across his body.
That was a sight.
-speak Scanlan
What's a duergar?
-speak Vax
That's a dark dwarf.
They're little fuckers, those are.
-speak Hieris
Aye, duergar.
-speak Matt
And he spits to the side.
-speak Hieris
Filthy lost souls. 
Dwarves of old that turned to a darker god. 
Thankfully, they live far beneath the mountains, and usually far north enough to not worry about it. 
But one of them found its way up here, in this strange, awful, maw-covered form. 
It was terrifying. 
And the smell! 
Anyway, we've even seen a few creatures from the surface as well, which is strange. 
They don't wander down. Something's bringing them. Weirdest thing.
I just heard we had some weird, many-headed serpent thing that just got killed down there. 
-speak Vex
Oh, that was us!
We just killed that last one that came out, you see.
-speak Hieris
That was you!
-speak Vex
Yes!
-speak Grog
Our hero is right over here.
-speak Scanlan
Hi.
-speak Matt
And he steps onto his back leg, shifting his weight, and cocks an awkward eyebrow.
-speak Hieris
Really?
-speak Scanlan
I'm really strong for my age.
-speak Percy
We're as surprised as anybody.
-speak Grog
Fearsome Scanlan.
-speak Scanlan
Actually, Hieris, I have a question for you.
You know the mines very well, yes?
-speak Hieris
Aye, I do.
-speak Scanlan
Far from asking you to draw us a map, are there any tunnels or directions that we should avoid or particularly head towards?
Anything that we should look for in terms of traps or tricks?
-speak Hieris
Not within our mines.
They're usually well-guarded.
Or, they were.
-speak Scanlan
Do you have a map?
-speak Hieris
Of the mines? Yeah, I do.
-speak Scanlan
Wonderful.
-speak Matt
He starts going through his notes here.
-speak Scanlan
I'll take that.
That's where we're going, right?
-speak Grog
We're goin' in the hole.
-speak Matt
It's kinda haphazardly scrawled across a piece of parchment, but he hands it over to you.
And he says:
-speak Hieris
So that's the front part of the mines.
Unfortunately, half of our tunnels have been relinquished.Sealed off to try stop some of these beasties coming through.
So we're gonna have to recarve portions of the mine as we progress forward.
Kind of starting at square one best we can.
But that at least is what we're currently working with.
There is a subterranean level as well.
We have an elevator inside that brings the various mine carts to and from.
-speak Vex
Is there a particular area on that map that most of the baddies seem to be coming from?
-speak Hieris
No, we've closed it off each time.
-speak Vex
Just kind of everywhere?
-speak Vax
And we noticed the, I believed it was the naga we fought, it seemed to have several extra heads stitched on.
Have you no knowledge of these creatures?
It seems very odd.
Is there any connection in dwarven history or past?
Or this is totally out of the blue?
-speak Hieris
No no, not to my knowledge, at least.
I mean, most beasts we find are in one piece, not several together.
It's a bit disturbing to be honest.
I told my nephew about it and he was crying for hours.
-speak Keyleth
Oh.
-speak Grog
Do any of the beasts go back into them?
-speak Hieris
Oh no, we've killed them as they come out each time.
-speak Keyleth
Hieris, do you know if there's any other entrances into the mine?
Any old secret tunnels, something that someone could be using to get in?
-speak Hieris
Not to the mine, this is all proprietary.
This is the business we run, so we don't have any internal or secret entrances.
That would leave us open to a sort of a thief to come in and steal our mithril.
-speak Vax
And what's security like on the mine?
Is there any chance someone could've slipped in through Kraghammer without you knowing, or is that all locked up?
-speak Hieris
Oh, I highly doubt that, not with the way our Carvers are trained.
-speak Vax
Understood, understood.
-speak Vex
They are quite-
-speak Hieris
That's what I'm talking about.
Fine dwarven study.
-speak Grog
Before we go-
-speak Hieris
Finest of military classes, aye.
Proud of 'em.
-speak Grog
What do you use for the-
-speak Hieris
I had a cousin who was once a Carver.
They raised him.
Military weapon training every day.
Couldn't come out and play with the rest of us.
I felt bad for him.
But he grew up to be a right nasty dwarf, aye.
-speak Vax
You say had.
-speak Hieris
Unfortunately, he was slain in one of the incursions.
That duergar I was telling you about.
But, such is the nature of the fighter, I suppose.
-speak Vex
A damn shame.
I'm so sorry.
-speak Hieris
I appreciate that.
To be honest, he was kind of a bastard, but um-- don't miss him too much.
But I appreciate the thought. That's very kind of you.
-speak Scanlan
We won't avenge him then.
-speak Hieris
I mean, still avenge him.
-speak Vax
Literally or figuratively?
-speak Hieris
I'm not sure.
-speak Grog
He had parents.
-speak Hieris
He had parents.
We were related somewhat. I'm not gonna say too closely.
-speak Laura
Can I ask a question?
-speak Hieris
Ah, yes.
-speak Laura
Not to you, to the other guy, Matt.
-speak Matt
Ah, yes. Yes, Laura?
-speak Laura
When we take a rest, do we get our spells back for the day?
-speak Matt
Not a short rest.
It has to be a long rest.
-speak Laura
All right, cool.
-speak Taliesin
Which is why we're gonna take a proper nap.
I think we should go buy some potions and take a nap.
-speak Laura
All right, this could be really bad.
I mean, we're about to put the dungeons in Dungeons and Dragons.
-speak Matt
There you go.
-speak Travis
Let's go get drunk and go to sleep then.
-speak Taliesin
And stock up on some potions.
-speak Percy
Hieris, you've been so helpful.
-speak Hieris
Of course, I'm happy to.
-speak Keyleth
One last question.
-speak Hieris
It doesn't have to be last.
You're welcome to stay as long as you like.
I don't get visitors to often up here in my booth.
-speak Keyleth
You should come drink with us at the tavern.
-speak Hieris
Oh well, I have to stay here.
Work, at least for the next six hours.
But I have some dried fruits. I've got some meats inside.
I've got two chairs and you-
-narrate
Matt gestures at Sam.
-speak Hieris
Could fit in my lap,
-speak Scanlan
I've killed.
-speak Hieris
Right.
-speak Grog
Look at the time.
-speak Vex
We have to go.
We'll come see you again, Hieris.
-speak Hieris
Of course, anytime. Or when we're not busy.
But when I'm not busy, you're welcome to come by.
-speak Keyleth
Oh, that'd be nice.
-speak Vax
Tell you what, when we drag our asses out of that mine, we'll come straight to you and buy you a drink.
-speak Vex
And we'll have some of that dried fruit.
-speak Grog
We're lying, right?
-speak Hieris
Oh, I'll save a batch for you, you half-elf lass.
-speak Vex
All right.
-speak Vax
Do the wink thing you do.
-speak Vex
I did, I already did.
-speak Vax
Oh, you did it already.
She's good at winking.
-speak Hieris
I saw, it was a good wink.
Aye. Made me tingle in my shoulders.
That might be the diabetes, but-
But mostly the wink, I think.
-speak Grog
Good.
-speak Keyleth
Oh, we should get him something other than dried fruit.
That's not good for diabetes.
-speak Percy
At least it means he's regular.
-hide hieris
-speak Travis
Back to the tavern.
Or did you have something?
-speak Sam
No, we're good.
Back to the tavern.
-speak Laura
What time is it?
Should we buy potions now?
-speak Travis
If we're underground-
-speak Laura
Oh, is everything open?
-speak Matt
As far as you guys know, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of late afternoon.
-speak Laura
Are the stores still open?
-speak Travis
It's summer.
-speak Matt
You can certainly check.
-speak Sam
It's like Las Vegas, it's always twilight.
-speak Travis
Do we get potions and stuff somewhere?
-speak Laura
Yeah, that's what we're looking for.
-speak Marisha
Maybe they have magical items.
I want stuff.
-speak Travis
Like plant stuff or potion stuff?
-speak Marisha
All stuff.
-speak Laura
Let's go look.
-speak Liam
I walk back to the Hieris' door, because we're all just standing outside the door.
-speak Matt
Correct.
-speak Liam
I walk back to Hieris's door and knock on it and poke my head in.
-show hieris 4
-speak Vax
Hieris, I'm sorry.
-speak Matt
You catch him with a handful of dried fruit.
-speak Hieris
Hmph! Hi!
-speak Vax
Just a quick question.
We have no fucking idea what time it is.
Because we usually use the sun. Do you know what hour it is?
Are businesses open at the moment?
-speak Matt
He reaches over and grabs this really awesomely intricate piece of clockwork on his desk.
It's this brass, ticking, cylindrical piece.
Springs and things making strange whirring sounds.
-speak Hieris
Oh, I reckon it's about two hours from sunset.
-speak Vax
Are the stores open at the moment?
-speak Grog
Better question.
-speak Hieris
As far as I know, aye.
Depending on the store.
-speak Vax
How much time do we have left?
-speak Hieris
Few hours.
-speak Vax
Oh, thank you, sir.
-speak Hieris
You sure you don't want to stay?
-speak Vax
Let's go shopping.
-speak Grog
Thank you, Hieris. Thank you.
Oh, gotta go, sorry.
-speak Hieris
Goodbye.
-speak Keyleth
It's the mine that never sleeps.
-speak Hieris
Good luck.
-speak Vax
Byeee!
-speak Hieris
Stay safe!
-speak Percy
Stay regular.
-speak Keyleth
Eat some veggies!
Fruit's bad for the diabetes!
-speak Travis
Oh, I put my head back in the door, and I throw him a turkey leg and a beef jerky stick.
I gotta get rid of this stuff.
It's been in here for years.
-speak Taliesin
The fact that you just checked your inventory for that worries me.
-speak Travis
We gotta lotta shit in this bag.
-speak Matt
The bag of holding, not so much a freezer.
-speak Travis
I didn't say it was good.
I just want it out.
-speak Marisha
And then you just throw it at him?
-speak Matt
The mildly rotted turkey leg hits the floor.
The remainder of what was once meat, now a slush sloughing off the bone as it slides towards Hieris.
-speak Grog
It's really tender.
-speak Vax
You're a goliath, you'll eat anything.
-speak Grog
Yeah, those are the best parts.
-speak Matt
You see he immediately steps back and his face squints back.
-speak Keyleth
That's not polite, Grog.
-speak Grog
I gave him a turkey leg.
-speak Hieris
It's the thought that counts.
-hide hieris
-speak Laura
All right, shall we all go looking for a magic shop?
-speak Taliesin
We have time, we might as well.
-hide keyleth
-speak Marisha
I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a squirrel and hide in Vex's pocket. 
-speak Matt
Make an investigation check.
-speak Laura
9?
-speak Matt
You ask around, but most people don't have any need for arcane shops.
So a lot of the dwarves you ask just look at you blankly.
-scene House Thunderbrand
-continue
One old, old man tells you about a cousin of his who studied magic at House Thunderbrand many years ago.
He gives you some vague directions.
Eventually you come across this out of place, very well-kept green lawn.
-speak Liam
How does the grass grow down here?
-speak Matt
It stretches for a good 60 feet to this beautiful-looking alabaster and gold building.
Slightly domed with four towers, one at each corner, with these blue pointed crystals on top of each tower.
Make a perception check.
-speak Laura
23.
-speak Matt
As you approach, you notice there are a series of stone sigils carved into the stonework that surrounds the exterior of the lawn.
-speak Percy
Well, those look dangerous.
-speak Laura
Can we look around and see if there's a bell to ring that's outside of that area?
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make a perception check.
-speak Taliesin
Can I assist on that?
-speak Laura
Yeah, please do, 'cause I rolled a 1.
1, baby.
-speak Taliesin
It's a 10.
-speak Laura
I failed it hard, I failed it.
-speak Taliesin
If you rolled a 1, there's nothing I can do anyway.
-speak Liam
We ain't found shit.
-speak Matt
Best you can tell, stonework's pretty solid.
-speak Laura
Cool!
-speak Vex
Hey, it's a house.
-speak Matt
As you look about, it's hard to tell the nature.
This looks just like a lawn with a well-framed stone exterior.
But there's no fence.
There's nothing keeping you from walking into the lawn and towards the building.
-speak Marisha
Can I do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow, or if it's like magical growing?
-speak Matt
No nature check required.
There is no light source, other than the red rocks that light up most of Kraghammer.
This kind of dull red glow that's around the entire city.
-speak Scanlan
I wonder what Keyleth is doing.
She's squeaking an awful lot.
-narrate
Marisha imitates squirrel squeaking.
-speak Laura
Oh that's right, she's in my pocket.
Hi!
-speak Grog
So we just walk up and-
-speak Laura
I pet her little head.
-speak Percy
Walking up sounds like a bad idea.
-speak Liam
Is there a front door?
-speak Matt
There is a large, beachwood-like double door in the front of the compound.
-speak Laura
Grog's gonna go.
-speak Liam
I'm gonna use my rogue abilities to walk up to the front door, and knock on it.
-speak Laura
Sorry Grog.
-speak Travis
I have one job.
-speak Liam
Can I see a bell?
-speak Matt
You step onto the walkway that leads towards the front of the building.
As you cross into the threshold where those stone sigils are, make a dexterity saving throw.
-speak Laura
Oh no.
Roll well, my brother.
-speak Liam
This is really not good for their business.
-narrate
Liam and Laura groan together as they see the roll.
-speak Liam
12.
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Matt
As you take a few steps forwards, you hear this strange clicking start.
And blue arcane energy pulses around your feet.
You instinctively pull back, but there's a blast of electric energy that explodes outwards.
Shocking your body and throwing you about 15 feet back, straight onto your shoulders.
You skid to a halt.
-speak Liam
Higigigigi!
-speak Matt
14 points of lightning damage.
-speak Grog
Should've let me go.
-speak Matt
Your muscles eventually relax.
-speak Grog
We have a flying carpet.
-speak Vex
Hey, we have a flying carpet!
We have a flying carpet. 
Pull it out.
-speak Travis
What?
-narrate
Laura cringes as she realizes she just told Travis to "pull it out".
-speak Marisha
Phrasing.
-speak Vex
Pull out the flying-
-speak Grog
Ohhh, the magic carpet.
You wanna fly it up to the door?
-speak Vex
It can't carry you, you're too heavy.
-speak Grog
I said you, not me.
-speak Vex
Oh, gimme that flying carpet.
-speak Grog
That's what I said.
-speak Laura
I hop on the flying carpet.
-speak Matt
Okay, so you pull the flying carpet, Mary Poppins-style, out of the bag of holding.
-speak Laura
Yes. And see if I can fly up and over to the door.
-speak Grog
Do you wanna tie a rope around your waist in case it goes bad?
-speak Vex
Oh. Is this a bad idea?
-speak Grog
No, do it.
-speak Scanlan
What could go wrong?
-speak Keyleth
I think you'll just, like, hit a wall.
-speak Vex
What if the flying carpet gets ruined?
-speak Scanlan
Let's not do that then.
-speak Grog
Oh my God, really?
-speak Vax
It's not gonna be ruined.
-speak Marisha
Wait, wait, wait, I'm in squirrel form.
-speak Laura
Oh, and you're with me.
Let's both fly to the door.
-speak Liam
I have nine healing potions-
-speak Scanlan
Hey, hold on, hold on.
-speak Grog
What what, you turned invisible and walked inside a house last time.
-speak Scanlan
Yeah, I can do whatever I want.
Do you want me to knock on the door, is that what we're trying to do?
-speak Sam
I send an unseen servant to knock on the door.
-speak Travis
What kind, like a buddy?
-speak Matt
Where do you create the unseen servant?
-speak Sam
Right on the doorknocker.
-speak Travis
Feet touching the ground?
-speak Travis
I'm just sitting back here holding the carpet.
~I can show you the world~
-speak Matt
You go ahead and you walk up to where that sigil is, you finish your spell, you cast unseen servant.
-speak Scanlan
~Unseen servant, ho~
-speak Matt
Which he says every time.
-speak Sam
Yes.
-speak Matt
Every single time.
You see this strange shift of air as some sort of humanoid form then materializes on the opposite side of this boundary and stands at your ready and command.
-speak Scanlan
We still haven't knocked on the door, correct?
-speak Vex
No.
-speak Matt
It's about a 60 foot walk.
-speak Sam
I command the unseen servant to knock.
-speak Matt
It kind of saunters over.
You guys see this kind of shifting, barely visible form make its way up to the front door.
In the distance, you hear a dull knocking.
-show steddos 4
-speak Matt
Eventually, the door slightly opens.
And you see a hunched figure with chalk-white hair, kind of look out from the doorway,
-speak Dwarf
Now, what is this?
-speak Matt
Looking at the form in front of him.
-speak Scanlan
Hello!
-speak Matt
Opens the door, comes out.
He's a very old dwarf, with a very well-crafted brass staff, looks like a black or purple gem at the top.
Spectacles at the tip of its nose.
And he begins to shift his way over towards you.
Walks right to the edge of the sigil.
Puts his hand up, and the unseen servant vanishes.
-speak Dwarf
So, you have my attention.
-speak Vax
We're sorry to interrupt.
I don't know, it's dinnertime, I think.
We just fought some sort of many-headed beast down at the mines, and Lord Greyspine is sending us in.
I don't know if you've heard yet, it just happened.
So before we go, we were sent here.
We were told you were the dwarf to speak to if we needed-
-speak Vex
To know about the magical entities.
-speak Vax
I thought it was just to get shit.
-speak Dwarf
If you're looking to buy trinkets and magical oddities-
-speak Vex
Trinkets!
-speak Dwarf
You've come to the wrong place.
This is a house of study.
This is where hardworking dwarves of arcane persuasion put their lives towards pursuing the magical forms and fields that-
-speak Scanlan
And we have come to seek your knowledge. 
We're going to investigate the source of the mutated creatures coming out of the mines.
-speak Dwarf
I'm sorry.
-speak Matt
The dwarf gives you a disapproving brow shift.
-speak Dwarf
Look, I mean no disrespect.
But understand, this is a dwarven house of arcane practitioning and study.
I don't see any dwarves among you.
I think our business here is concluded.
If you're looking to buy stuff, we produce and sell through the Value of Valor house of sale.
-speak Percy
Of course, sir, we completely understand if you're not up to such a challenge.
It makes perfect sense, and we'll be more than happy to go and buy some wares somewhere else if this is too much for you.
-speak Dwarf
Bah! Challenge.
-speak Matt
The dwarf turns around and begins walking away with his staff.
-speak Marisha
I'm going to drop squirrel form to cast Alter Self on myself and become a dwarf.
-show dwarfwoman2 -4
-speak Vex
We have a dwarf with us who wanted to actually say hello to-
-speak Sam
You better fucking speak dwarvish.
-speak Matt
Smiles for a second as he looks at you and goes: 
-speak Dwarf
Ah, how nice to meet you.
Where are you from?
-narrate
Marisha puts on a truely horrible Scottish/Cornwall accent.
-speak Keyleth
Oh, hello.
-narrate
The table bursts into laughter as they hear her.
-speak Laura
Oh, shit.
-narrate
Liam speaks some Swedish-accented gibberish.
-speak Sam
Ya, from Sweden.
-speak Travis
I'm gonna choke on a chip.
-speak Marisha
Keyleth is not good at this.
-speak Liam
Roll with it player, roll with it.
-speak Keyleth
I hail from the mountains up north.
-speak Vex
She had an accident on the way over here.
We were hoping maybe-
-speak Matt
Roll a persuasion roll with disadvantage.
-speak Liam
Let the dice act better than us tonight, please.
-narrate
Travis puts on a high-pitched imititation of Marisha.
-speak Travis
Oh, hello!
-speak Marisha
I have a zero in persuasion.
Eight.
-speak Matt
That's your first roll.
Now roll again.
-speak Marisha
Oh, I have advantage?
-speak Matt
No, you have disadvantage.
-speak Marisha
Oh.
So eight.
-speak Dwarf
I've been practicing the arcane arts for over 250 years. 
-speak Keyleth
And I've been practicing my Cornwall accent for five minutes.
Shit.
-speak Matt
He raises his hand, and the Alter Self spell dissipates.
-hide dwarfwoman2
-show keyleth -4
-continue
Revealing Keyleth.
-speak Scanlan
Oh Keyleth, you've been lying to us this whole time?
We thought you were a dwarf.
-speak Liam
Vax steps forward, steps in front of Keyleth and says:
-speak Vax
Good sir dwarf.
Clearly we are idiots.
We are-
-speak Dwarf
That's the first true thing you've said since you've called me out of my home.
-speak Vax
Stay with me on this.
We are strangers in a strange land.
However, we are working with Lord Greyspine to empty your mines and end the evil that is spewing forth from them.
Now I know that we are a bit stupid, in a number of ways.
-speak Vex
But we fight well.
-speak Vax
But we fight well, and we have the best of intentions, and when it counts, we're there.
We just need a little bit of help going into the mines.
And again, Lord Greyspine himself sent us, so please excuse my-
Challenged friends.
We're here to help.
I promise.
-speak Travis
That's a very Disney moment.
-speak Laura
I wink twice.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion roll at disadvantage.
-speak Laura
Can I assist him 'cause I winked?
-speak Matt
No.
-speak Laura
Damn it.
-speak Travis
It's a powerful wink.
-speak Matt
It's a powerful wink, but not this powerful.
Not the way this conversation's been going.
-speak Travis
Yeah, apparently not.
Oh hello!
-speak Liam
Best roll of the night.
I rolled a 20 and a 17.
So 19.
-speak Matt
19.
He glares at you two and goes:
-speak Dwarf
I've said my piece.
Good luck to you all.
-speak Laura
If you had gotten the 20.
-speak Liam
How about a chocolate-covered mallomar?
-speak Sam
I'm gonna have one more try at this.
-speak Matt
He turns around and starts walking away.
-speak Scanlan
There must be so many arcane things down there that we will discover and bring to you upon finding them.
-speak Vex
Good call, Scanlan.
-speak Scanlan
Things that you could use for your research.
Historical items.
-speak Matt
As he's still walking away, you hear him shout over his shoulder, 
-speak Dwarf
And when you bring them, then we'll talk!
-speak Scanlan
Okay, that's fair.
-speak Dwarf
Till then, good day, and don't bother me when I'm eating.
-speak Vex
Thank you, Lord Thunderclap.
-speak Liam
This game has consequences.
-speak Matt
At which he shouts again at a booming, booming prestidigitation voice:
-speak Dwarf
It's THUNDERBRAND!
-speak Vex
That's what I meant.
-hide steddos
-speak Matt
You hear the door slam, boom!
-speak Grog
That was fun.
-speak Scanlan
That was great!
-speak Vex
Should we go buy some potions then?
-speak Percy
Yes, let's go buy some potions.
-speak Scanlan
He gave us a little bit of information.
The valve of valva, what's it?
Valor of-
-speak Grog
Vulva?
-speak Scanlan
The place to go buy potions.
-speak Vax
It's not the House of Vulva, Grog.
-speak Matt
The Value of Valor.
-speak Sam
The Value of Valor!
-speak Grog
If you want to visit the House of Vulva, you and I can go later. But not now.
-speak Vex
The Value of Valor, let's go find that.
-speak Keyleth
I'm sorry.
I didn't think about the fact that I was gonna have to do an accent.
I'm not good with that stuff.
-speak Vex
It's okay, Keyleth.
-scene The Value of Valor
-speak Matt
So after a bit of discussion, you manage to make your way around town.
You eventually find your way to the Value of Valor, which is a stone building.
-speak Laura
Please be open, please be open, please be open.
-speak Matt
Fine purple tapestries in the front, showing various battles from dwarven history.
There are two enchanted lanterns hanging from the front.
-speak Taliesin
Classy.
-speak Matt
And an entryway that is currently open, into a warmly-lit interior.
-speak Travis
Awesome.
-speak Liam
So easy.
-speak Scanlan
Hey, before we go in there and just make asses of ourselves, as a group, what do you think we need to get down into these mines?
-speak Vex
Potions.
-speak Percy
Healing potions.
-speak Scanlan
Healing potions.
Some light sources--
Climbing anything?
-speak Vex
I have climbing gear.
-speak Scanlan
I have some climbing gear, but--
-speak Laura
That's included in the dungeoneering kit, right?
-speak Matt
Yes.
-speak Scanlan
Oh, what about something for breathing?
Like what if we get trapped down there with no air?
-speak Vex
She can make plants, and we'll get plenty of oxygen.
-speak Keyleth
Oxygen's good, although if we have something to help with poison, that might be good.
Can we get some antidotes?
-speak Vax
Vex. How much gold do we have at the moment?
-speak Vex
That is a wonderful question, brother.
We will more than double our gold if we take this mission.
-speak Grog
So we got like 24,000 gold pieces?
-speak Vex
Less than that.
-speak Grog
23 thousand.
-speak Vex
Less than that.
-speak Grog
22 thousand?
-speak Vax
More than double, that means it could be one thousand.
'Cause anything is more than double.
-speak Vex
I don't like sharing.
-speak Grog
Math is stupid.
-speak Sam
All right, we go into the House of Vulva.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Scanlan
Open your vulva!
-speak Matt
That's not what it's called.
-speak Travis
Are you sure you don't wanna think about renaming it now?
-speak Matt
It's the Value of Valor guys, come on!
-speak Taliesin
You're tearing the party apart.
-speak Liam
Tearing me apart, Lisa.
-speak Matt
A giant boulder falls out of nowhere and crushes Grog.
-background bricks
-continue
So you make your way inside.
Suddenly, hit with the smell of heavy incense and jasmine.
This is the equivalent of a Psychic Eye Bookshop.
-speak Marisha
Oh, we were just there.
-speak Taliesin
We were just there.
-speak Matt
You walk inside.
There's not a lot of folks inside looking about the establishment.
But there is one person sitting at the front desk, which is a beautiful long oak table with a red trim that hangs to the ceiling.
Not a dwarf, actually.
-show tremaine 4
-continue
What you see there appears to be an elven individual, sitting at wait, hair pulled back behind the ears.
Very, very slight, thin build.
And smiles as you enter and says, 
-speak Merchant
Welcome to my establishment, may I help you?
-speak Laura
We both stand a little taller, and try to look more noble.
-speak Vax
Hello.
It's a beautiful shop you have here.
It's so startling to find an elven establishment here in the middle of Kraghammer.
How did this come about?
-speak Merchant
Well.
They didn't have one.
And I found there was perhaps money to be made in starting one.
I've been here for over a hundred years.
-speak Grog
Oh sh- Are you guys that old?
-speak Vax
No, we are not.
-speak Merchant
Dwarves have a hard time buying from those who are not dwarves.
But I've made my established connections with business individuals.
So, what can I help you with?
-speak Percy
We're in the market for some healing potions to start with.
-speak Grog
Yep, yep.
-speak Merchant
Of which intensity are you looking for?
-speak Grog
Two level 3, please.
-speak Merchant
So looking for a superior healing potion.
-speak Grog
Yeah, superior.
-speak Merchant
I've only got two of those currently.
-speak Vex
They're expensive, Grog.
-speak Keyleth
We don't have Pike, though.
-speak Merchant
I can sell you the two superior healing potions.
-speak Keyleth
I'm still not feeling well.
-speak Merchant
Those will run you 1,500 gold pieces each.
-speak Grog
Fuck! Really?!
-speak Percy
This is why you buy medium healing potions.
-speak Keyleth
On second thought, I'll just read some books tonight.
-speak Grog
I take damage fast.
-speak Keyleth
Refresh myself on my healing spells.
-speak Vex
Can I ask your name?
-speak Matt
He gives you a keen look and says:
-speak Tremaine
Tremaine.
-speak Vex
Tremaine.
-speak Grog
Oh, here we go.
-speak Keyleth
It's what she's good at.
-speak Grog
Everybody take five while we haggle.
-speak Vex
I'm just saying.
We're heading into the mines.
We are going to encounter very many arcane objects potentially.
In fact, Lord Thunderbrand sent us over here.
That's his name, right?
-speak Grog
You got it.
-speak Percy
You did it right.
-speak Vex
Sent us over here telling us to find his wares here.
And we've made a deal with him that if we find arcane objects we could potentially-
You know, I lost track of what I was saying, but you get the idea.
-speak Scanlan
Oh boy.
-speak Grog
I'll take one superior for me, thank you.
-speak Tremaine
Very well.
-speak Vex
We'll very much like to perhaps make a deal with you, that we'll bring you objects of arcane nature for a discount on your wares.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion roll.
-speak Grog
Oh shit.
I just paid for--
-speak Vex
Oh, no you didn't.
Not yet.
-speak Liam
Roll, sister.
-speak Laura
Oh, come on, no whammies, no whammies.
Okay, well.
15, hm?
-speak Travis
He's an old elf.
-speak Matt
He says:
-speak Tremaine
And I appreciate this perhaps offer.
Once you return from your mines with these magical accoutrements, you are more than welcome to bring them here, and we'll make a deal.
-speak Vex
I know, I know, I know.
How many dragons have you come across, sir?
Are you interested in dragon parts?
-speak Grog
Oh, we have a lot of dragon bits.
-speak Matt
He extends his hand to a shelf on the side labeled, dragon parts.
-speak Vex
Oh. Lovely.
-speak Tremaine
And to answer your question, three.
-speak Vex
Oh, really?
-speak Grog
What about basilisk eggs?
-speak Vex
What kind of dragons, actually?
-speak Tremaine
What was your question, sir?
-speak Grog
We have also, if you're interested in trade, basilisk eggs and parts of an umber hulk.
-speak Vax
And a troll dick.
-speak Grog
No, that's gone.
We flogged someone with it and then it disappeared.
-speak Vax
I detract my offer.
-speak Grog
It was used very well.
-speak Matt
He gives you a very concerned look.
-speak Grog
I'm a collector of sorts.
-speak Tremaine
I work in trade, meaning gold pieces for my wares.
If you have interest, purchase.
If not, I have other business to attend to.
-speak Scanlan
Any other healing potions to buy?
Come on people.
-speak Vex
Maybe a moderate.
-speak Vax
All right, well friends, we're about to descend into hell itself, so I reckon we should probably pay the price.
-speak Percy
Two moderates.
-speak Matt
Greater.
In the new edition.
-speak Percy
Greater.
-speak Keyleth
How much are the greaters?
-speak Tremaine
The greater healing potions run 300 gold apiece.
-speak Vex
Oh, let's get a few of those.
-speak Grog
I need like three of those.
-speak Tremaine
So, three?
-speak Grog
Yeah, three.
-speak Vex
Two for me.
-speak Tremaine
So, five.
-speak Percy
Two for me as well.
-speak Tremaine
Seven.
-speak Grog
Keyleth.
-speak Keyleth
I'll take one.
-speak Tremaine
Eight.
-speak Scanlan
I still have two from before.
-speak Grog
Vax?
-speak Vax
No, I'm good actually.
I'm so fast I don't really use them that much.
You'll get to that point as well.
-speak Vex
8 potions then.
-speak Grog
8 times 300, work that out.
-speak Matt
As he pulls up his arcane calculator.
-speak Vex
So 2,100 for all 8 then.
-speak Taliesin
It's an abacus, God, abacus!
-speak Grog
I believe it's 2,400 gold pieces?
-speak Vex
Why would you do that?
I was trying to make him--
-speak Tremaine
It is 2,400.
-speak Grog
It's Professor Grog, actually.
-speak Matt
2,400 gold pieces for your 8 greater healing potions.
-speak Laura
All right, 2,400.
Do you have any arrows that perhaps have magical properties?
-speak Matt
He kind of glances over his shoulder and says:
-speak Tremaine
Ah, we haven't had many requests for arrows recently.
We have bolts for crossbows, as that seems to be the staple for the Carvers of the city.
I have two sleep arrows, perhaps, if that is of interest to you.
-speak Laura
And what would you charge for those, sir?
-speak Percy
Ooh, I should build some interesting arrows.
-speak Keyleth
You should.
-speak Tremaine
That would run you 250 gold per arrow.
I have two currently.
-speak Vex
All right, all right, I'll take 'em.
-speak Tremaine
All right, 500 gold.
With that, that is a total of 2,900 gold pieces.
-speak Grog
Scanlan, underwater breathing?
Ask with your fancy talk.
-speak Scanlan
And do you have anything for adventuring underwater or for helping to breathe in tight spaces?
-speak Tremaine
Mm, potion of waterbreathing, I do happen to have.
-speak Scanlan
A potion of waterbreathing?
-speak Tremaine
Yes, I do.
-speak Scanlan
How much?
-speak Tremaine
I have four of them available, and they run 500 gold apiece.
-speak Scanlan
Jesus.
-speak Grog
We'll take it.
We got all this platinum I forgot about.
-speak Scanlan
Take one, two, one?
-speak Vex
Don't say that!
-speak Grog
He can't hear-
-speak Scanlan
I've got spells, I don't need a potion.
You want one, Grog?
-speak Grog
Yeah.
-speak Scanlan
All right, we'll just take one of those.
-speak Grog
Just one?
Let's go for two.
-speak Scanlan
Two.
-speak Tremaine
1,000 gold.
That brings us to 3,900 gold.
-speak Vex
Are you paying for those yourself?
-speak Grog
Yep.
-speak Vax
Have you any elven gear for a son of Syngorn?
-speak Matt
He gives you a keen look and goes:
-speak Tremaine
We don't get many requests for this, but I think this may fit you.
-speak Matt
And he reaches below and pulls up a fine piece of mithril chain, elven in make.
-speak Vex
That's what I'm wearing.
-speak Tremaine
Mm hm.
-speak Grog
Show-off.
-speak Matt
He says, 
-speak Tremaine
Would you perhaps be interested in this elven chain?
-speak Vax
It's beautiful.
I am a bit of a light-footed one.
Would it suit me?
-speak Tremaine
Hm.
Chain does make a bit of a racket.
Might not recommend it, unfortunately.
-speak Vax
All right.
I'll pass.
-speak Grog
You couldn't buy it for me?
-speak Vex
It won't fit you, it's for elves.
-speak Vax
You're gigantic.
-speak Grog
Could go on my pinky or something.
-speak Vax
Could fit on your left nut.
-speak Grog
That's an important nut.
-speak Matt
He goes ahead and accepts your gold.
Go ahead and mark off 3,900 gold for those.
-speak Laura
I did already.
-speak Matt
Thank you for your patronage.
I look forward to hopefully having you back when you return with whatever artifacts you manage to find.
-speak Grog
Thank you, you're very nice.
-speak Vex
Big expensive artifacts.
-speak Percy

And I'd love to do a crafting roll right before I go to sleep just to put together a little thing.

I look around for something that can look like a pillow for him.
-speak Matt
You find a couple of sacks of grain that can probably work.
-speak Laura
I put them down and make them comfy for him.
-speak Matt
Okay, you think they're probably not gonna last the night with those bear claws.
But you don't care, it's not your grain.
-speak Laura
That's fine.
Also, I feed him.
-speak Matt
Okay, Trinket is very happy.
Tears into some meat.
You guys make it back to the tavern for an evening's rest.
For Percy-
-speak Taliesin
Not a super complicated thing, but, you know, I've gotta-
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make a Tinker's Kit roll.
-speak Taliesin
What am I rolling with my Tinker's Kit?
I've never done this before.
-speak Matt
For this, I would go ahead and make it an intelligence check.
-speak Taliesin
Intelligence?
-speak Travis
Rock that shit, Perce.
-speak Taliesin
And I'm spending my bonus die as well.
-speak Laura
Oh, we have bonus die, don't we?
From Scanlan.
-speak Taliesin
Thank God, because I rolled really badly.
10.
-speak Matt
10?
You spend and toil away for the next four or so hours trying to find a way to get this trigger to work.
Twice you nearly sprain a finger.
You manage seemingly get it to function, then the arrow itself splits and shatters.
You can see there being something to it, but this night it's not gonna come to you.
-speak Taliesin
I'm gonna have to try again later.
Okay, that's fine.
It's on the list.
That was a terrible roll.
-speak Matt
It was a terrible roll.
-speak Marisha
It's been a bad day for rolls.
-speak Laura
Fresh start in the morning.
-speak Sam
Well, tomorrow is the day that it counts, because that's when we begin to crack some heads.
-speak Laura
When we could die.
-speak Taliesin
Out with this system, new dice.
-speak Marisha
To be fair, it's been a long day.
I'm still bleeding everywhere.
-speak Scanlan
Should we rest and get on with it?
-speak Vex
Let's do it!
-speak Scanlan
Or should we visit some whorehouses?
-speak Grog
Nah, let's sleep.
-speak Scanlan
Let's just sleep tonight.
-speak Vex
Just sleep and go.
-speak Grog
I they're still tired from the other night.
-narrate
Travis mimes punching his own jaw, and then punching outwards.
-speak Scanlan
Oh yes, one of them battered me quite--
-narrate
Travis looks confused at his own miming.
-speak Travis
I don't know what this is.
-speak Sam
That's me getting beaten up by a whore dwarf.
-speak Travis
Oh, it's you getting the elbow drop.
She's giving you the Randy Savage from the bedpost.
Oh yeah!
We're sleeping now.
-speak Matt
All right.
So you guys go to sleep.
Wake up the next morning fully healed, spells restored, well rested and ready for the day.
You think it's day.
It's hard to tell.
This underground circumstance is really messing with you guys.
-scene To the Mines
-speak Sam
Well, should we go plunder some mines and kill some goblins?
-speak Vex
Let's do it.
-speak Percy
Let's go plunder some mines.
-speak Travis
So we head down to the mines.
To the hole.
~Takin' it to the hole~
-background kraghammer
-speak Matt
You make your way down to the bottom ring of Kraghammer.
To the mines proper.
The miners have gone back to work.
There's just an all around busyness with people cleaning up, still trying to clean out the ichor left over from the battle.
You make your way to the front of the mines, and immediately three of the Carvers step back and put their weapons to the side.
Acknowledging the orders they received from Lord Greyspine.
-speak Travis
Are they especially bowing to Scanlan the snake slayer?
-speak Matt
Ha. No.
-speak Travis
No love!
-speak Matt
They're busy working.
And fair play to the gnome, but they're dwarves.
-speak Sam
Sure.
-speak Matt
You make your way into the mine proper.
It goes back for a good 10 minutes of walking and of winding.
You can see the actual track of the minetrack leading around.
You come upon a couple of dwarves.
They nod at you as you pass, but then go right back into mining.
It looks like this portion of the mine has been nearly picked clean.
The dwarves that are in there are probably just wasting time to get their pay for the day.
You go further back and eventually it opens up.
Following the map, you get to a portion of the mine that is very busy.
You get the feeling that the areas that haven't been closed up are trying to make up the difference in productivity, trying to find new veins.
You notice that some of the doors you pass have been shattered, knocked off the hinges.
You imagine whatever creatures were barreling through last night, this is probably where they came through.
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Taliesin
That's where we're going.
Can I investigate the doors, see if I can see anything interesting?
-speak Laura
I'm gonna look for tracks.
-speak Matt
That'll be an investigation roll for you as well.
-speak Marisha
I'm gonna assist her, look for animal tracks.
-speak Laura
I rolled a natural one again.
-speak Marisha
I rolled a 5.
-speak Laura
Keyleth and I get dressed up in Sherlock Holmes cosplay, and we say:
-speak Vex
Golly gee, I think I see some animal tracks over here.
-speak Taliesin
They are staring at their own footprints on the ground.
-speak Keyleth
The trail's going cold!
-speak Taliesin
Following around in a circle.
-speak Matt
Oh man, this has turned completely back from the first game.
You guys are failing consistently.
-speak Laura
Everything.
-speak Matt
Let's turn this around, let's turn this around.
-speak Vax
This map says that there's an elevator a short ways ahead.
But then there's a railway that goes further in, into the caves, so I'm not sure.
-speak Vex
We should probably go down.
-speak Keyleth
Yeah, I feel like going down.
-speak Sam
How many of us can the elevator hold?
-speak Matt
Elevator can pretty much hold all of you guys.
-speak Sam
Okay, let's go.
-speak Vax
It's a safe assumption that Lady Kima did not just walk to the back of the upper floors, she probably went down.
-speak Scanlan
Yeah, let's go down, come on!
-speak Vax
Get shit done, let's go.
-speak Matt
As you guys are walking over to where the elevator is, you pass by two large piles of rubble.
Part of the ceiling has collapsed.
Tunnels going much deeper into the mountain that were detonated or collapsed to try prevent any incursions.
There are some dwarven corpses being carried out, as well as goblin corpses.
-speak Scanlan
Any goblin corpse is a good goblin, I say.
-speak Scanlan
I'll just quickly spit on their bodies as they go by.
-speak Matt
You guys go ahead and approach the elevator.
It's a large wooden platform with a series of chains.
-show dwarfman3 6
-show dwarfman2 8.5
-continue
There are two dwarves in the back, beside a giant iron wheel.
As you approach, they look you up and down, surprised anyone is going down.
-speak Dwarf
Well, step on the platform.
-speak Vex
Let's do it.
-speak Matt
The two dwarves grab and begin to rotate the giant wheel.
The platform shudders for a second.
As it begins to lower, you can feel the actual platform shake a little bit as the whole weight is placed on the chains.
-speak Percy
Guys.
We're on an elevator.
-speak Keyleth
This is scary.
-speak Laura
I pet Trinket, calm him down.
-speak Keyleth
I've never been on one of these before.
-speak Matt
Trinket is a little nervous.
-speak Keyleth
It's really tight.
-speak Percy
I'm on an elevator with a bear.
-speak Keyleth
It's really dark, tight.
-speak Laura
Are we down yet?
-speak Marisha
Keyleth's getting a little claustrophobic.
She's never been in this tight of a space.
-speak Grog
Are you claustrophobic?
-background black
-hide dwarfman2
-hide dwarfman3
-speak Matt
You guys hit the bottom floor.
There's some minecart tracks leading from this elevator that curve to the left and lead deeper in.
To the right of you is a spiral staircase upwards, you can see a dwarf corpse being carried up it.
-speak Laura
Can I look for goblin tracks down here and follow those?
-speak Matt
You can attempt another investigation check.
-speak Sam
Why don't we just ask the dwarves where they were getting the bodies?
-speak Travis
You're gonna roll crap.
-speak Laura
Don't curse me.
-speak Marisha
Please don't do that.
-speak Laura
17.
-speak Matt
So as you guys are going to ask somebody about this, your ranger gets down and begins inspecting the floor.
-speak Laura
Yeah, I see things!
-scene Following Tracks
-speak Matt
There was a struggle here.
You can see slash marks on the ground.
You can see impacts in the dirt where bodies fell.
You can see drag marks, not in the direction they came from, but further down into the tunnel.
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-speak Matt
As you follow the tracks, you notice that a good 200 feet away from the elevator, there is a new tunnel opening.
A 20 by 15 foot tunnel, freshly blasted from the other side.
You can see rubble and rocks strewn across the floor.
-speak Scanlan
Let's go down there.
Where it's dangerous.
-speak Travis
I cup my hands over my face and go:
-speak Grog
Grog, Grog, Grog.
-speak Matt
And it does echo.
Grog, Grog, Grog, Grog.
-speak Vex
Why would you do that?
-speak Grog
Why not?
-speak Matt
Grog-Grog. Grog.
Following the tracks, you can see the drag marks do go into the newly carved tunnel.
You also notice footprints.
-speak Laura
Big, small?
-speak Matt
Most of them are also dwarven in shape.
-speak Laura
Okay.
-speak Marisha
Most of them.
-speak Liam
Duergar.
It's the duergar.
-speak Matt
However, there are two bodies that are being dragged with no footprints whatsoever.
-speak Travis
What?
-speak Laura
Wings.
-speak Sam
They're being used like skateboards.
-speak Marisha
Legolas style.
-speak Sam
Wow, if only we had asked some dwarves what's been going on down here.
-speak Laura
Is there any residue, blood?
Green, red, black?
-speak Matt
From the dragging marks, there is no blood.
There's no signs of them dragging dead bodies off, at least.
-speak Laura
Does it look like they struggled?
-speak Matt
No, there's no struggle either.
-speak Vax
Let's stop dicking around and go into that mine.
-speak Vex
Might as well.
-speak Travis
We go further.
-speak Matt
You push further in.
So, this tunnel, pitch black.
There's no light source.
-speak Marisha
I'll light a torch with Druidcraft.
-speak Matt
You guys push forward.
And push forward, following the tracks.
And push forward.
And the tunnel winds and winds and descends.
And winds and descends.
About two hours-
-speak Everyone
What?!
-speak Matt
Two hours following this tunnel with little variation.
-speak Laura
Should've grabbed some dried fruit.
-speak Travis
We got a ton.
-speak Matt
Steadily declining and winding as it progresses.
Three hours go by.
This tunnel goes extremely deep.
Whatever managed to dig its way up came from pretty far down.
-speak Laura
At no point does it look like the bodies ever moved?
-speak Matt
Nope, no change.
No sign of struggle.
-speak Marisha
But there are drag marks the whole way?
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Liam
And two hours ago, I started stealthing and taking the lead.
When we're in the dark.
-speak Matt
All right, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
-speak Laura
I thought I was tracking.
-speak Liam
Uh, 29.
-speak Laura
Yay, first good roll of the night.
-speak Matt
All right, there we go.
Your luck is changing now.
-speak Laura
Changing it around.
-speak Travis
Let me touch you.
-speak Matt
You feel pretty stealthy.
You guys are like, wait, where the hell did Vax go?
-speak Marisha
Are there any drafts?
Do I feel any air flows or anything like that?
-speak Matt
No. It is still, stagnant air.
-speak Matt
About four hours-
-speak Sam
Four!?
-speak Keyleth
And so, that is how I spent my 12th birthday.
-speak Scanlan
Great story, Keyleth.
And, yeah.
-speak Keyleth
Let's see, what else.
-speak Grog
Hey Scanlan, you kill me, I kill you.
-scene The Cavern
-speak Matt
As the four hour mark of travel, the tunnel finally opens up.
A large, beautiful open space presents itself, a good 100-foot-up ceiling.
From what you can see, a roaring river is now pouring out of the nearby rock, cascading over a cliffside into a waterfall down into this deeper, giant cavernous space.
And that's where we're going to take a break.
See you back here in 15 minutes.
-narrate
The cast leaves for break, and then rejoins.
-speak Matt
Welcome back.
As you've stepped into this large, cavernous space, you can hear the rush of water from a short waterfall.
It's just out of sight in the darkness.
-speak Laura
Vax and I just stealthed.
I rolled 17.
-speak Liam
18 for me.
-speak Matt
As you guys step into this space, you can see several large rocks jutting out, blocking your view deeper into the cavern.
Giant stalagmites and stalactites throughout, built over centuries of mineral deposition.
You also see a faint light source, coming from further in, out of view.
-speak Laura
Should we go check it out?
-speak Liam
Do we perceive anything in here with us?
Before going that far in.
-speak Matt
Make a perception check.
-speak Liam
18.
-scene A Sound in the Cavern
-speak Matt
You hear a very, very faint sound in the distance.
-narrate
Matt makes a rapid clicking sound.
-speak Sam
A skittering.
-speak Vax
I might hear spiders.
-speak Keyleth
Oh.
-speak Laura
Ugh.
-speak Grog
Or crab.
-speak Vax
Or something.
-speak Keyleth
Making it old school.
-speak Scanlan
Maybe it's a very faint maraca dance of some sort.
-speak Laura
What direction is it coming from?
-speak Travis
That would be better.
-speak Matt
It's hard to tell at this point, it seems to be just kind of loosely atmospheric.
-speak Travis
Is the light coming from over the water?
-speak Matt
No, its between you and the river.
-speak Travis
Okay.
-speak Vax
I think we're dealing with spiders.
-speak Vex
I think you guys should hang back, and we should stealth over and see how many it looks like we're dealing with.
-speak Liam
The twins will creep forward.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You both creep forward.
-speak Laura
Trinket stays with the group.
-speak Vex

But it's large.
It's not a small creature.
You glance off to your left and you look up and you see a second one.
-speak Laura

That's beautiful.
Look at that fun map.
-speak Matt
There's Trinket.
-speak Liam
Thank you, Matt, for doing all the work on these maps and shit.
-speak Matt
That's what I do.
So there's the water there, rushing off into the waterfall that goes further down.
-speak Sam
What are they?
-speak Travis
Those look like umber hulks.
-speak Matt
They are.
-narrate
A couple of the cast yell in fear.
-speak Matt
You've had one brief run-in with a single umber hulk in the past.
-speak Laura
Now we have two.
Fudge!
-speak Travis
I have their claws still.
-speak Laura
Wait, do you guys remember-
Do they respond to vibration?
-speak Travis
Shit! I forget.
They responded to something.

What's your AC?
-speak Taliesin
17.
-speak Matt
You just manage to dodge out of the way as these giant-bladed claws sweep next to your face.
The second strike comes to you at a 21.
-speak Travis
Oh shit.
-speak Taliesin
That hits.
-speak Matt
All right, so the claw finds purchase across your torso.
The armor catches most of it.
You still feel the taste of iron in the back of your throat.
You suffer nine points of slashing damage.

-speak Matt
You take 14 points of slashing damage, as the mandibles slice down, clamping onto your shoulder.
You manage to pull free, but in doing so, you wrench the pointed portions of the mandible across your shoulder, pulling open the flesh in this horrible jagged pattern.

To try to distract him.
-speak Matt
All right, so go ahead and roll your d8 to reduce his attack roll.

Three.
-speak Matt
That brings it to a 17 to hit.
-speak Travis
My AC is 18.
-speak Sam
I saved your life!
-speak Matt
So, as you begin singing out-
-speak Sam
~No motherfucker~
-speak Matt
It pulls back its mandibles to strike at Grog, it looks off to you for a second.
At which point Grog has put his axe up to its face and is holding it at bay.

You spin the barrel, go back to fire again, and it jams.

You haven't raged yet!
It isn't your turn yet.
-speak Travis
But I'm so angry.
-speak Matt
I know.
You're about to be so angry.
The mandibles crush down on your body, and you can feel them pierce into your chest.
Your exposed musculature is then torn in a jagged form as you feel the blood begin to pour down the front of your torso.

Okay, so, as you leap on its back, grab purchase on one of its chitinous plates.
Bring your first dagger forward and jam it into the side of its head.
As it pulls back, you hear a snarl.
It reaches for you with one of its claws to try and knock you off.
You pull your other dagger, and pierce it into the other side of its head.

-speak Matt
You go ahead and pull two arrows, letting them loose, kind of letting a little bit of faith take your arrows to the wind.
Both finding purchase on your foe.
-speak Laura
Can I use the blazing bowstring on that one?
-speak Matt
You can, yes.
-speak Laura
Sweet. 29 damage total.

There's some bedding, and what was once a campfire and is now a pile of embers.
