Hello everyone, and welcome to the second episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us crazy voice actor, nerdy types sit here and play Dungeons and Dragons.
We'll be continuing from last week's adventure, so in the meantime, let's go ahead and show you some of the character backstory.
-speak Travis
Right, listen up.
If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw.
A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale.
-narrate
(record scratching)
-speak Travis
Wait.
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things.
Also ale.
In his early years, armed with his two-handed greataxe, Grog oft enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd, but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this,
-narrate
(chuckles)
-speak Travis
this terrified little thing.
His disobedience cost him dearly.
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die.
Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him.
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.
And they have remained close friends ever since.
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches, ha!
Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors, huh.
Also ale.
-speak Marisha
A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid.
You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet.
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions.
-narrate
(lightning roaring)
-speak Marisha
Under that unintimidating, petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally.
-narrate
(giggles)
-speak Marisha
Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics.
It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begins to bleed with this realm.
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beastshaping abilities.
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts, which I do.
-narrate
(clears throat)
-speak Marisha
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations.
Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters.
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself.
Not knowing when, or if, she will ever return.
As she hikes down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader.
With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
-speak Taliesin
Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism.
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court.
During a feast held in their honour, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell.
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.
He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible.
Then one night, Percy had a dream.
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family.
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.
-narrate
(gun clicking)
-speak Taliesin

-narrate
(explosion roaring)
-speak Sam
Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you.
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother.
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion.
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known, the true love of a fellow gnome.
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third.
On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike.
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
-speak Orion
Greetings and salutations.
I am Tiberius Stormwind.
I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, from a politically respected family.
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic.
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history.
For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring.
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time.
In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world.
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend.
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye.
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.
I found those answers to be unacceptable.
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.
Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia.
Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there.
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that.
-narrate
(mutters)
-speak Orion
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.
I just don't pay attention to things sometimes.
I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.
I can't help but show my true scales every now and then.
But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
-speak Liam
Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door.
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry.
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn.
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last.
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road.
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth.
But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble.
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.
Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
-narrate
(loud roaring)
-speak Liam
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely.
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,
-narrate
(sword slicing)
-speak Liam
the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
-speak Laura
Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other.
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador.
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own.
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods.
She preferred the isolation.
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot.
And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen trinket,
-narrate
(bear growling)
-speak Laura
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.
Also, he is adorable and gives expert massages.
Welcome back everyone.
So, know that you're a little more affiliated with the characters, let's get this party started.
So as a head's up, I wanna let you know, once again, we're waiting for the charity elements of this stream to open up again, since the big charity that happened a couple weeks ago.
Once we do, we're gonna be taking donations, half to go to help run the channel, the other to donate to 826.
Marisha will explain that here in just a second.
As a head's up, Ashley, who plays our cleric, Pike, unfortunately couldn't make it again this week, because she's busy filming amazing stuff with her career being amazing.
But she says she's sad she can't be here.
She loves you guys, and as soon as Pike can re-enter the campaign, hopefully in a couple weeks, all awesome gnomeness shall double.
So also tonight, there was a goal to try and hit 1,000 subscribers on the channel.
So what we're gonna do is, we only have 130 people to subscribe tonight.
If we can get all 130 before the show ends this evening, we're gonna do a random selection of a person within those thousand subscribers to win a copy of the Player's Handbook signed by all of us, as well as a really, really cool image that was tweeted out earlier by Geek & Sundry, also signed by all of us.
So, go ahead and pull your friends, see if we can get some more subscribers before the show's out tonight, so hopefully that'll be fun.
So, Marisha, if you wanna go ahead and explain a little bit about the charity 826 we'll be plugging in the near future.
Yes, 826 LA is a non-profit charity organization that helps kids though the age of six to 18 with their creative and structural writing skills, and they also help teachers and yeah.
Good artsy creative things.
So donate, and definitely visit the Time Travel Mart.
-speak Sam
Wait, can we donate?
-speak Matt
Tonight we can't donate here.
-speak Marisha
We can't donate tonight yet?
-speak Matt
It's not available yet.
Start saving your money.
-speak Sam
Not yet.
-speak Marisha
But you can still go to the Time Travel Mart in Echo Park and you can also go to their website, 826LA, and I'm sure you can donate through there if you want to do that.
Part I
-speak Matt
Yes, but we'll be getting that going in the near future.
So, anyway.
Let's go ahead and do a little recap of what happened last week.
So the party has been hired by their friend, Arcanist Allura Vysoren, in the city of Emon to head towards the dwarven town of Kraghammer, as a good friend of hers, and one of the members of the Council of Tal'Dorei, has gone missing.
This, being a halfling paladin, named Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage and was drawn towards some dark evil she said was manifesting somewhere deep beneath Kraghammer and hadn't been heard from since.
So the party was sent there to go ahead and seek her.
Upon arriving in Kraghammer, shenanigans ensued.
They made some friends, made some enemies, wandered the town.
Brother, sisters, walked around as if they were married.
-speak Laura
No!
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Bears almost got into fights in rings.
And eventually the party made their way towards the bottom ring of Kraghammer proper, talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who is--
-speak Orion
That's right, Greyspine.
-speak Matt
Yes, Greyspine indeed.
Who is the head of the Greyspine Mines at the bottom of Kraghammer, where supposedly this paladin disappeared to.
After having a conversation with him, a bunch of goblins and ogres began to spring from the mines and attacking the workers.
The party swooped down to aid, realized that the goblins and ogre's weren't attacking, they were fleeing from something else, of which emerging from within the mines proper some strange naga-based hydra-ish abomination.
The party then proceeded to slaughter it, final blow dealt by Scanlan via lightning bolt.
-speak Sam
Hi, Scanlan here, hi.
-speak Matt
Our resident gnome bard.
-speak Travis
Yeah, you did!
-speak Matt
And that's where we pick up.
So, as all of you are still riding the adrenaline of the battle, Scanlan feeling the tingling in his fingers as the little bolts of arcane energy kind of
-narrate
(imitates electricity crackling)
-speak Matt
spark throughout, the rest of the nearby workers and miners slowly converge in and begin to walk up to the party.
And someone starts,
-speak Matt
That was great, that was well done!
Fantastic!
Where'd you learn that?
-speak Matt
One of them comes up there, 
-speak Matt
Ah, I could've done better than that.
-speak Matt
And they start just shouting off at each other and pat each other on the back.
A few moments of this progresses before, all of a sudden, there's a hush comes about the crowd, and you see about five or six Carvers pull their way through, Carvers being the guards of Kraghammer, with Lord Nostoc Greyspine himself stepping through.
He looks at the rest of the group and goes, 
-speak Matt
All right, so you've certainly proven yourselves in battle.
-speak Orion
Well, of course we have.
I'm sorry.
-speak Matt
I would like to continue this conversation that we had back in my office if you don't mind.
-speak Marisha
Oh wait, Nostoc.
He's not even listening, he's just walking off.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Marisha
Yeah, mmm.
Ooh, shall we turn and follow?
-speak Laura
Are you still an eagle?
Can you even talk to him?
-speak Taliesin
Shouldn't you just go caw?
-speak Marisha
Well I'm not an eagle.
But I am still poisoned.
-speak Laura
Oh, I can help you.
-speak Marisha
Oh, that'd be great.
-speak Laura
Yeah!
-speak Laura
Hold on, I'm gonna go up, and I'm gonna cast--
-speak Sam
Cast?
Yeah, I can cast spells.
-speak Sam
You can cast?
-speak Laura
I can.
I've got plenty o' spells.
-speak Liam
You can kill?
-speak Sam
All right, fair enough.
-speak Laura
I'm gonna cast Protection from Poison on Keyleth.
-speak Matt
Okay.
Essentially go ahead and make a saving throw with advantage.
This'll be Constitution.
-speak Marisha
I made the second one.
-speak Matt
What'd you roll?
-speak Marisha
A 10.
Plus my constitution which is two, three, thirteen.
-speak Matt
So thirteen?
-speak Marisha
Yes.
-speak Matt
 That'd be enough. So, after you finish casting the spell, you feel the poison leave the rest of your body. You can kind of take a breath to yourself. The rest of the miners kind of look about and Awkwardly staring back at Nostoc as he walks off, kind of looking back like, what "Are you gonna go? "Talk to him?" 
-speak Sam
Yeah, I guess we should go follow him.
-speak Taliesin
We have two very important questions.
TRAVIS: Can't we look in the hole a little bit more.
-speak Orion
No Grog, we need to go do this.
-speak Laura
We're gonna go in the hole in just a minute, Grog.
-speak Orion
Then you can smash, you'll be fine.
-speak Travis
You promise?
-speak Liam
You did that last night.
We need to take care of business.
Let's go talk to the man.
I'm sure it's going to lead back to the mines.
-speak Marisha
To the hole.
-speak Liam
Yes, to the hole.
Everything's back to the hole.
-speak Sam
Percy, do you have something to say before we go?
-speak Taliesin
Well, this is good.
We have to find out what that was, and we have to see if he'll finally give us some of that ale, I think are the two most important things.
-speak Laura
It was wine, I believe.
-speak Sam
No, it was bloody, bloody beer.
-speak Laura
Bloodline.
Bloody wine, blood wine.
-speak Travis
Bloodier, ale.
Beerwine.
-speak Matt
It was delicious is what it was.
-speak Travis
It was really good.
-speak Laura
Let's go talk to Nostoc.
-speak Sam
Let's follow him, let's follow him.
-speak Taliesin
Okay, this is what's important.
-speak Matt
All right, so as you head back to the ramp that heads up from the mine enclosure itself to the top of the realm, which is where the Greyspine Industries mining facility is, you are brought into the building again, brought back to Nostoc's office, in which he's not sitting, he's kind of pacing behind his desk, waiting for you as you approach.
As you enter the room, he stops pacing, turns around, puts his hand on the desk, and says, Please, enter and close the doors behind you.
-narrate
(loud thud)
-speak Orion
Sorry, I didn't mean to slam the door like that.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
A flatulent dragonborn, eh?
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Sam
Sir Greyspine.
Lord Greyspine?
Mr.
Greyspine?
-speak Matt
Lord Greyspine is fine.
-speak Sam
Lord Greyspine, yes.
Why have you summoned us here?
Is it to tell us information about what just came out of your mine, I hope.
-speak Matt
Well let's be clear.
We dwarves don't need help from outsiders.
We can handle our own business just fine.
-speak Laura
Of course.
-speak Marisha
Speaking of outsiders, you wouldn't happen to have seen a Lady Kima, would you?
-speak Matt
As what the discussion was based on previously, you're searching for her, and last we saw her, She went down into the mine.
-speak Laura
We already talked about that, Keyleth.
-speak Travis
Yep, we did.
-speak Liam
They don't like her, she was a troublemaker and she went in.
-speak Travis
You're an eagle.
-speak Laura
She's in the mine.
We'll go in and find her.
Right?
Lord Greyspine?
-speak Matt
You're welcome to.
As far as I know, she's down there somewhere.
Hopefully still in one piece.
-speak Laura
While we're there, would you like us to take care of any other problems?
-speak Matt
Getting to that.
You see these small intrusions have been bad for meeting our quotas with the Bronzegrip metal warehouse and export shipments.
Employees have been forced to collapse a non-negotiable portion of our tunnels to prevent incursions like this.
Without my approval.
And this is a pattern I wish to stop at once.
Thus, I have a proposition for you.
Now, I will give you free reign to our mines.
I shall get the proper approvals to make sure no Carvers bother you as you wander the city's lower ring.
And I will contract you to delve past our tunnels and investigate the source of these creatures, where they come from, where they live, and if there is some sort of a leader who gives them their commands.
Eliminate them.
For this, I will reward you with not a trifle sum.
25,000 gold pieces.
Plus 250 gold per beast scalp you provide upon returning.
-speak Laura
Ooh, I like this.
-speak Orion
Grog, this seems like a wonderful job, doesn't it?
-speak Sam
Money is wonderful.
We like money.
But we've been charged to find Lady Kima.
We need assurances that we will find her or at least some evidence of her in the mines.
-speak Matt
The brazen halfling bitch went in there without my approval and wandered into the mines, not to be seen.
So if she is down there, I hope she's in one piece.
I can't guarantee it.
But if there's any place to find her, that's probably it.
-speak Liam
We're the group of adventurers for you.
I don't know if you've heard of the heroes Emon, who just recently- I'm sure you've heard something.
Word travels fast.
-speak Matt
Not beneath this mountain, it doesn't, of human closers.
-speak Liam
We've just done a lot of good to the ruler of Emon.
-speak Matt
Great.
How does that help us dwarves?
-speak Orion
We're saying we are going to help you, too.
And everything will be fine, and we'll all be happy.
-speak Laura
Well, we've discovered, in our past adventures, however, is that every realm seems to be having trouble with the same sort of creatures, coming up from the Underdark perhaps?
-speak Liam
All we're saying is, help us help you.
What exactly have you seen before this day?
More of the same?
Or other creatures?
-speak Matt
He sits back for a second.
-speak Matt
The types of creatures, I do not know.
I mostly deal with the business and just know that there's some bullshite going on down in the mines.
You could ask our foreman, Hieris.
He's dealt with the cleanup each time we've had an incursion like this, so if anyone has information on what these creatures are, he'd be the one to talk to.
-speak Liam
Sorry, what was his name again?
MATT, SAM, LAURA: Hieris.
-speak Matt
He's a foreman at the mine proper.
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Taliesin
I think this seems like the sort of job we'd want to take.
LAURA, ORION: Yes.
-speak Travis
Will we get paid for the monsters and creatures we've already slayed?
-speak Matt
This deal was not sewn in yet, so no.
-speak Travis
Oh.
-speak Matt
But we thank you for your aid.
-speak Taliesin
As I think you are all aware.
-speak Laura
Truly, truly.
-speak Liam
See, I wasn't just fucking with you last week.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Liam
That's a thing we do.
-speak Taliesin
And since we are about to risk our lives.
.
.
-speak Travis
I forgot you did that.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion roll.
-speak Taliesin
Yes!
Happily.
-speak Travis
Roll good, it's the first one.
-speak Liam
Come on, Percy!
-speak Taliesin
14.
-speak Laura
Oh.
-speak Sam
It's pretty good.
Not great.
-speak Matt
You can see this long, distant, angry, dwarven, mistrusting stare.
Rubs his chin, his well-kept, blackened beard and goes, 
-speak Matt
Huh, but a sip, as it was a gift.
-speak Laura
Yes!
-speak Sam
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Sam
We'll take it.
He pulls the ale barrel which you guys provided, sets it on the side of his desk with the same spigot that you had placed in when you presented it earlier and says,
-speak Matt
Take a bit.
A bit.
-speak Laura
-narrate
(whispering)
-speak Laura
Put some in a bottle.
-speak Orion
We have to save some for those guards.
-speak Liam
Let me take care of it.
I'll pour everyone a glass.
-speak Liam
Oh, thank you, brother.
I take my empty water flask that I emptied out before, and am smiling and pouring glasses and also squirting a little bit here and there as I want.
I start to just play a little ditty on the flute.
I thought we could accompany our sip with a little bit of music, not to distract you, just to--
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Liam
just to sort of accompany us.
-speak Matt
His nose squints at the sound.
-narrate
(SAM imitates a jaunty flute)
-speak Matt
Gnomish tunes aren't to my ears and liking.
-speak Laura
Yay.
-speak Matt
All right, so go ahead and make a -
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Matt
Make a sleight of hand check on this.
-speak Liam
Okay.
That's what we do, right?
-speak Laura
Roll well.
Here we go.
LAURA AND
-speak Liam
Oh, no.
-speak Sam
You have inspiration dice.
-speak Taliesin
Inspiration dice are d8?
-speak Matt
Yep, you add a d8 to it as well.
-speak Liam
Okay, and I can add a d8 to this?
-speak Matt
Correct.
-speak Taliesin
The ale is that good.
-speak Liam
Oh good.
Now I'm at 19.
-narrate
(Travis groans in relief)
-speak Liam
Hey.
-speak Matt
As he's listening to the gnomish music and kind of pushing it away with his hands, like, 
-speak Matt
Stop, I don't- no.
I appreciate it, but I don't.
-speak Sam
All right, there's not accounting for taste.
-speak Matt
As you do that, your wineskin goes to full.
-narrate
(imitates liquid sloshing)
-speak Matt
Swollen to its brim.
You switch over to one of the cups, you pass around the drinks.
All of you manage to get your drinks passed around.
-speak Laura
Huzzah!
-speak Matt
To a contract!
-speak Travis
Aye!
Huzzah!
-speak Taliesin
To a contract.
-speak Marisha
Contracts.
-speak Sam
L'chaim!
-speak Marisha
Love contracts.
-speak Liam
Is that Draconian?
-speak Sam
It's Gnomish.
-speak Taliesin
To risking our lives.
For money.
-speak Laura
How old is Nostoc?
Just out of curiosity.
-speak Matt
It's hard to tell.
Dwarves live quite a long time.
He would be equivalent to like a human forties.
Dwarven time, somewhere in his mid-hundreds.
-speak Marisha
Smells like its been in the barrel for a hundred years.
-speak Orion
It has been.
-speak Laura
This is excellent.
-speak Liam
Tastes like two buck Chuck.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Orion
Oh, I know him from Quimdendale.
-speak Travis
What do you know of a Ballsac up in the tavern?
-speak Matt
I'm sorry, what?
-speak Travis
Do I have that right?
-speak Laura
Ball, ball -
-speak Marisha
Balgus.
GROUP: Balgus.
-speak Matt
Ah, Balgus, that's the brand of what you brought me.
-speak Sam
You know what, I think we asked about him last time.
-speak Laura
I think we did.
-speak Orion
Also, may we take a short rest before we leave this facility?
-speak Marisha
Yes, could we do that?
Is this considered a short rest?
-speak Laura
Oh yeah, that actually would be good.
-speak Matt
If you'd like to do that, that would just be taking a short rest outside, probably not in the office proper.
-speak Laura
Understandable.
-speak Matt
You can leave and just sit down and get some rest.
-speak Laura
When we take a rest, can I look for Hieris?
-speak Matt
You can as well.
So, while you guys are taking a short rest, you're able to use any of your hit dice to heal up naturally.
-speak Travis
We don't naturally heal up?
-speak Matt
That is your natural healing.
Not to full.
It's a continuation, Grog.
-speak Sam
I will sing a song of rest.
And it goes a little something like, ♫ Scanlan make you feel good ♫ ♫ Scanlan make you feel real good ♫
-speak Orion
Oh, I feel so good.
-speak Sam
No wait, you get an extra d6 on all your heals.
-speak Travis
I appreciate the slow jam.
-speak Matt
Yeah, on every hit dice, you get an extra d6.
-speak Travis
R.
Kelly would agree.
-narrate
(Matt laughs)
-speak Laura
I didn't take any hit points.
I'm at full health.
-speak Matt
So you got a slow jam just for the sake of the slow jam.
-speak Laura
That's right.
And it was great.
-speak Matt
All right, roll an investigate check.
-speak Orion
It feels good.
Real good.
-speak Laura
Okay.
Oh, 25.
-speak Matt
A brief discussion with a few of the other wandering dwarf miners that are in the outskirts of the buildings' facilities.
Eventually it leads you over to what is a small, secondary building maybe 200 yards off from the main property.
That apparently is where Hieris resides and keeps watch over the entire establishment.
-speak Liam
I've tagged along.
-speak Laura
Knock knock knock.
-speak Matt
All right, the rest of you going with her?
-speak Sam
Yeah, we'll go with her.
-speak Matt
Why not!
Why split the party?
So the group makes their way over to the outskirts of the building.
Opens up and a very nice, portly looking dwarf with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard.
Big reddish, ruddy nose.
Leather apron on.
And he opens the door.
-speak Matt
Aye, hello!
Nice to meet you.
What can I do for ye?
-speak Laura
Hi.
You must be Hieris?
-speak Matt
I am, I am.
Foreman of this here fine mine.
-speak Laura
Wonderful to meet you.
I've heard wonderful things about you.
-speak Matt
Oh, have you!
From who?
-speak Laura
Uh, from Lord Greyspine himself.
-speak Matt
Really?
Oh.
All right.
Well, how can I be of service?
-speak Laura
We were curious.
I'm sure you witnessed all of those wonderful goblins and trolls and other nonsense coming out of the mine.
-speak Matt
Aye.
Nasty lot.
It always makes my weeks that much more interesting.
-speak Laura
Weeks?
So this has been happening for quite a while?
-speak Matt
Unfortunately, at least five or six.
-speak Laura
And what kind of monsters have you been dealing with?
-speak Matt
Terrible kinds.
-speak Matt
He starts rubbing his chin for a little and goes, 
-speak Sam
Ooh, god.
-speak Matt
Slimes and oozes that would mutate and change color rapidly before seeming to dissolve on their own.
Unstable-looking really, in their form.
-speak Sam
Like a goblin centipede?
-narrate
(Laura, Liam, Travis laugh)
-speak Matt
If you will, aye aye.
-speak Orion
Sounds more like some type of necromancy magic.
-speak Matt
Perhaps, but they're not undead, per se.
They're still alive.
At least from what we can tell.
Whatever agony face them in their physical form.
-speak Orion
Oh, that's even worse.
-speak Matt
We even had one brief run-in with what looked like a duergar that had swollen and sprouted eyes and mouths all across his body.
That was a sight.
-speak Sam
What's a duergar?
-speak Liam
That's a dark dwarf.
They're little fuckers, those are.
-speak Matt
Aye, duergar.
-speak Matt
And he spits to the side.
-speak Laura
Oh, we just killed one of those.
-speak Matt
That was you!
-speak Laura
Yes!
-speak Travis
Our hero is right over here.
-speak Sam
-narrate
(clears throat)
-speak Sam
Hi.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
And he steps onto his back leg, shifting his weight, and cocks an awkward eyebrow.
-speak Matt
Really?
-speak Sam
I'm really strong for my age.
-speak Orion
We were all surprised.
-speak Taliesin
We're as surprised as anybody.
-speak Travis
Fearsome Scanlan.
-speak Sam
Actually, Hieris, I have a question for you.
You know the mines very well, yes?
-speak Matt
Aye, I do.
-speak Sam
Far from asking you to draw us a map, are there any tunnels or directions that we should avoid or particularly head towards?
Anything that we should look for in terms of traps or tricks?
-speak Matt
Not within our mines.
They're usually well-guarded.
Or, they were.
-speak Orion
Also, do you have a map?
-speak Matt
Of the mines?
Yeah, I do.
-speak Orion
Wonderful.
-speak Matt
He starts going through his notes here.
-speak Orion
I'll take that.
-speak Sam
That's where we're going, right?
-speak Travis
We're goin' in the hole.
-speak Matt
It's kinda haphazardly scrawled across a piece of parchment, but he hands it over to you.
-speak Matt
And he says, 
-speak Matt
So that's the front part of the mines.
Unfortunately, half of our tunnels have been relinquished to close off some of these beasties coming through, so we're gonna have to recarve portions of the mine as we progress forward.
Kind of starting at square one best we can.
But that at least is what we're currently working with.
There is a subterranean level as well.
We have an elevator inside that brings the various mine carts to and from.
-speak Laura
Is there a particular area on that map that most of the baddies seem to be coming from?
-speak Matt
No, we've closed it off each time.
-speak Laura
Just kind of everywhere?
-speak Matt
Oh no, we've had a few tunnels they've come through, but we've managed to collapse those and make sure they're not coming through again.
-speak Liam
And we noticed the, I believed it was the naga we fought, it seemed to have several extra heads stitched on.
Have you no knowledge of these creatures?
It seems very odd.
Is there any connection in dwarven history or past?
Or this is totally out of the blue?
-speak Matt
No no, not to my knowledge, at least.
I mean, most beasts we find are in one piece, not several together.
It's a bit disturbing to be honest.
I told my nephew about it and he was crying for hours.
-speak Marisha
Oh.
-speak Orion
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Travis
Do any of the beasts go back into them?
-speak Matt
Oh no, we've killed them as they come out each time.
-speak Matt
Not from what I've seen, no.
-speak Marisha
Hieris, do you know if there's any other entrances into the mine?
Any old secret tunnels, something that someone could be using to get in?
-speak Matt
Not to the mine, this is all proprietary.
This is the business we run, so we don't have any internal or secret entrances.
That would leave us open to a sort of a thief to come in and steal our mithril.
-speak Liam
And what's security like on the mine?
Is there any chance someone could've slipped in through Kraghammer without you knowing, or is that all locked up?
-speak Matt
Oh, I highly doubt that, not with the way our carvers are trained.
-speak Liam
Understood, understood.
-speak Laura
They are quite--
-speak Matt
That's what I'm talking about.
-speak Laura
Yeah.
-speak Matt
Fine dwarven study.
-speak Travis
Before we go--
-speak Laura
Strong ale.
-speak Matt
Finest of military classes, aye.
Proud of 'em.
-speak Travis
What do you use for the--
-speak Matt
I had a cousin who was once a carver.
Raised him there.
His whole family brought him up on that side.
Military weapon training every day.
Couldn't come out and play with the rest of us.
I felt bad for him.
But he grew up to be a right nasty dwarf, aye.
-speak Liam
You say had.
-speak Laura
Where is he now?
-speak Matt
Unfortunately, he was slain in one of the incursions.
That duergar I was telling you about.
But, such is the nature of the fighter, I suppose.
-speak Laura
A damn shame.
I'm so sorry.
-speak Matt
I appreciate that.
To be honest, he was kind of a bastard, but um-- don't miss him too much.
But I appreciate the thought.
That's very kind of you.
-speak Sam
We won't avenge him then.
-speak Matt
I mean, still avenge him.
-speak Liam
Literally or figuratively?
-speak Matt
I'm not sure.
-speak Travis
He had parents.
-speak Matt
He had parents.
We were related somewhat.
I'm not gonna say too closely.
-speak Laura
Can I ask a question?
-speak Matt
Ah, yes.
-speak Laura
Not to you, to the other guy, Matt.
-speak Matt
Ah, yes.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Yes, Laura?
-speak Laura
When we take a rest, do we get our spells back for the day?
-speak Matt
Not a short rest.
It has to be a long rest.
-speak Laura
All right, cool.
-speak Taliesin
Which is why we're gonna take a proper nap.
-speak Laura
We're gonna take a real nap?
-speak Taliesin
I think we should go buy some potions and take a nap.
-speak Liam
I think so.
-speak Laura
All right, this could be really bad.
I mean, we're about to put the dungeons in Dungeons and Dragons.
-speak Travis
Let's go get drunk and go to sleep then.
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Matt
There you go.
-speak Taliesin
And stock up on some potions.
Hieris, you've been so helpful.
-speak Matt
Of course, I'm happy to.
-speak Marisha
One last question.
-speak Matt
It doesn't have to be last.
You're welcome to stay as long as you like.
I don't get visitors to often up here in my booth.
-speak Marisha
You should come drink with us at the tavern.
-speak Matt
Oh well, I have to stay here.
Work, at least for the next six hours.
-speak Liam
All night, do you get off in six more hours?
-speak Matt
Aye.
But I have some dried fruits.
I've got some meats inside.
I've got two chairs and you could fit in my lap,
-speak Sam
I've killed.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Right.
-speak Orion
This one needs a whore, sorry.
-narrate
(Sam grunts)
-speak Matt
Fair enough.
-speak Liam
What's a mic?
-speak Matt
Forget that, you heard nothing.
It's a strange echo in the caverns of Kraghammer.
Anyway--
-speak Travis
Look at the time.
-speak Laura
We have to go.
We'll come see you again, Hieris.
-speak Matt
Of course, anytime.
When we're not busy.
But when I'm not busy, you're welcome to come by.
-speak Orion
All right.
-speak Marisha
Oh, that'd be nice.
-speak Liam
Tell you what, when we drag our asses out of that mine, we'll come straight to you and buy you a drink.
-speak Laura
And we'll have some of that dried fruit.
-speak Travis
We're lying, right?
-speak Matt
Oh, I'll save a batch for you, you half-elf lass.
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Liam
Do the wink thing you do.
-speak Laura
I did, I already did.
-speak Liam
Oh, you did it already.
She's good at winking.
-speak Matt
I saw, it was a good wink.
Aye.
Made me tingle in my shoulders.
-speak Matt
That might be the diabetes, but--
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
But mostly the wink, I think.
-speak Travis
Good.
-speak Marisha
Oh, we should get him something other than dried fruit.
That's not good for diabetes.
-speak Travis
Back to the tavern.
-speak Taliesin
At least it means he's regular.
-speak Travis
Or did you have something?
-speak Sam
No, we're good.
Back to the tavern.
We go back to the Iron Hearth Tavern, right?
Is that what it's called?
-speak Matt
For those who are asking, that's West Country, is the accent.
-speak Laura
Yes.
-speak Matt
Cornwall.
-speak Laura
What time is it?
Should we buy potions now?
-speak Travis
If we're underground--
-speak Laura
Oh, is everything open?
-speak Matt
As far as you guys know, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of sunsettish afternoon.
-speak Laura
Are the stores still open?
-speak Travis
It's summer.
-speak Matt
You can certainly check.
-speak Sam
It's like La Vegas, it's always twilight.
TRAVIS:: There you go.
-speak Orion
If you all don't mind, I suggest we item up a bit, and before we get too late, and we get too drunk, Grog, go back to that lightning -- main-- manor-- lightning cage.
-speak Laura
Oh, that place.
-speak Matt
House Thunderbrand?
-speak Orion
House Thunderbrand.
-narrate
(Matt laughs)
-speak Travis
Where do we item up?
Do we get potions and stuff somewhere?
-speak Laura
Yeah, that's what we're looking for.
-speak Liam
When you say too drunk, do you mean 
-speak Matt
we
-speak Matt
the adventurers or the humans back in Los Angeles?
-speak Orion
Both parties.
Cross-plane.
-speak Marisha
Cross-Realm.
-speak Orion
And I tell them what happened, again.
-speak Sam
What happened?
-speak Orion
Well, I went to this door because--
-speak Sam
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.
-speak Matt
You later rested, shot arcane magic at the home of arcane magic in Kraghammer.
-speak Orion
And if we are to go down into this cave, perhaps they have some insight into what's going on there as well.
Especially at this point in.
-speak Laura
Let's hurry and try to get them before they go to sleep.
-speak Marisha
Maybe they have magical items.
I want stuff.
-speak Orion
And I priorly had luck with more than--
-speak Travis
Like plant stuff or potion stuff?
-speak Marisha
All stuff.
-speak Liam
Have you had any luck finding an arcane--
-speak Laura
That's what we're talking about.
-speak Liam
No, I know that.
Did you send any fireballs at doors again like you've done in the past, or--?
-speak Orion
Yes, I knocked, as I do often do.
And nothing doing.
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Liam
Got it.
-speak Travis
So, magic stuffs.
-speak Laura
Let's go find them.
-speak Taliesin
All right.
-speak Marisha
So wait-- it seems like they really don't want you in their door.
It seems very heavily guarded.
So what's our plan, we just going to try again?
-speak Laura
Well it was nighttime before.
Maybe they'll be more--
-speak Sam
We're gonna do what we always do: wing it.
-speak Taliesin
We're gonna try it again, except we're gonna watch this time.
It'll be fun.
-speak Matt
There you go.
-speak Marisha
Let's do it.
-speak Liam
I walk back to the door, because we're all just standing outside the door.
-speak Matt
Correct.
-speak Liam
I walk back to Hieris's door and knock on it and poke my head in.
Hieris, I'm sorry.
-speak Matt
You catch him with a handful of dried fruit, 
-speak Matt
Hmph!
Hi!
-speak Liam
Just a quick question.
We have no fucking idea what time it is.
Because we usually use the sun.
Do you know what hour it is?
Are businesses open at the moment?
-speak Matt
He reaches over and grabs this really awesomely intricate piece of clockwork on his desk.
It's this brass, cylindrical piece that as he pulls out you hear this
-narrate
(tongue clicking)
-speak Matt
, fring!
And springs and things making strange whirring sounds.
-speak Matt
Oh, I reckon it's about two hours from sunset.
-speak Orion
Oh, very good.
-speak Liam
Are the stores open at the moment?
-speak Travis
Better question.
-speak Matt
As far as I know, aye.
Depending on the store.
-speak Liam
How much time do we have left?
-speak Matt
Few hours.
-speak Liam
Oh, thank you, sir.
-speak Matt
You sure you don't want to stay?
-speak Liam
Let's go shopping.
-speak Travis
Thank you, Hieris thank you.
Oh, gotta go, sorry.
-speak Matt
Goodbye.
-speak Marisha
It's the mine that never sleeps.
-speak Matt
Good luck.
-speak Liam
Byeee!
-speak Matt
You hear the door open behind you, and he starts waving at you guys.
-speak Matt
Stay safe!
-speak Taliesin
Stay regular.
-speak Marisha
Eat some veggies!
Fruit's bad for the diabetes!
-speak Travis
Oh, I put my head back in the door, and I throw him a turkey leg and a beef jerky stick.
I gotta get rid of this stuff.
It's been in here for years.
-speak Taliesin
The fact that you just checked your inventory for that worries me.
-speak Travis
We gotta lotta shit in this bag.
-speak Matt
The bag of holding, not so much a freezer.
-speak Travis
I didn't say it was good.
I just want it out.
-speak Marisha
And then you just throw it at him?
-speak Matt
The mildly rotted turkey leg
-narrate
(imitates moist impact)
-speak Matt
across the floor.
The remainder of what was once meat, now a slush sloughing off the bone as it slams across the stone floor.
-speak Travis
It's really tender.
-speak Liam
You're a goliath, you'll eat anything.
-speak Travis
Yeah, those are the best parts.
-speak Matt
You see he immediately steps back and his face squints back.
-speak Marisha
That's not polite, Grog.
-speak Travis
I gave him a turkey leg.
-speak Matt
It's the thought that counts.
-speak Orion
Hold, hold on.
Before he does that, I cast prestidigitation, and I clean it up real quick.
-speak Matt
Okay, that's really kind of you.
-speak Orion
And I hand him a parchment and go, if there's anything wrong, just write the message on this, and we'll come help.
If there's any emergency.
And I hand him a parchment from the Scroll of Telescription that I made.
-speak Matt
All right.
Thank you kindly.
-speak Laura
How many pages is that scroll?
Is it endless?
-speak Orion
I made like 15 tickets right now.
And it takes me an hour to craft.
-speak Matt
He takes it from you with trepidation.
You can see he probably hasn't encountered dragonborn often, and he's like, 
-speak Matt
Thanks.
-speak Orion
Remember, dragonborn, we're good.
-speak Matt
Right.
-speak Orion
So long.
And I leave.
-speak Matt
Thank ye.
-speak Laura
Do you want to go with him to the enchanting place or do you wanna go somewhere else?
-speak Liam
I think I will go with him just to keep him from setting fire to the entire city.
-speak Laura
All right, shall we all go to the manor?
-speak Taliesin
We have time, we might as well.
-speak Orion
Are we iteming up first?
-speak Taliesin
I figure we do that after.
-speak Laura
I think we'll do that.
-speak Marisha
I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a squirrel and hide in your pocket.
-speak Laura
I like it.
-speak Marisha
Okay.
-speak Laura
Ugh, Grog.
-speak Travis
What, it was a burp!
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Technically in character.
-speak Travis
Much worse from the other end, I guarantee.
-speak Sam
Okay, so we're going to House Thunderbeards?
Thunderbirds?
-speak Matt
You guys head to the House Thunderbrand.
-speak Sam
Brand.
-speak Matt
All right.
So, Tiberius leads you to where it's residing.
Once again you come upon what looks like a very out of place, very well-kept green lawn that stretches for a good 60 feet before you see this really beautiful-looking alabaster and gold building, slightly domed with these four towers to each corner, with these blue pointed crystals on top of each tower.
-speak Liam
How does the grass grow down here?
-speak Laura
Can we see any traps or glyphs that are active?
-speak Matt
He points out to you as you approach, there are a series of stone sigils carved into the stonework that surrounds the exterior of the lawn.
-speak Orion
Those things!
-speak Laura
Can we look around and see if there's any way to, a bell to ring that's outside of that area.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make a perception check.
-speak Taliesin
Can I assist on that?
-speak Laura
Yeah, please do, 'cause I rolled a one.
One, baby.
-speak Taliesin
It's a 10.
-speak Laura
I failed it hard, I failed it.
-speak Taliesin
If you rolled a one, there's nothing I can do anyway.
-speak Matt
What'd you roll?
-speak Liam
We ain't found shit.
-speak Travis
She rolled a one.
-speak Matt
Rolled a one naturally?
-speak Laura
I did.
-speak Matt
Best you can tell, stonework's pretty solid.
-speak Laura
Cool!
Hey, it's a house.
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Matt
There are dwarves around.
No.
-speak Travis
Good.
-speak Matt
As you look about, it's hard to tell the nature.
This looks just like a lawn with a well-framed stone exterior.
-speak Laura
Cool.
-speak Matt
But there's no fence.
There's nothing keeping you from walking into the lawn and towards the building.
-speak Marisha
Can I do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow, or if it's like magical growing?
-speak Matt
No nature check required.
There is no light source, other than the green rocks that generally permeate the interior of Kraghammer to give its kind of strange luminescent atmosphere.
This kind of dull red glow that's around the entire city.
Other than a couple of sparks of lantern light.
There's no light source.
-speak Sam
I wonder what Keyleth is doing.
She's squeaking an awful lot.
-narrate
(Marisha imitates squirrel)
-speak Laura
Oh that's right, she's in my pocket.
Hi!
-speak Travis
So we just walk up and--
-speak Laura
Can I pet her little head.
-speak Orion
No, I don't suggest that, Grog.
I shoot firebolt.
-speak Matt
I forgot that wasn't water.
-narrate
(coughs)
-speak Taliesin
Did you actually try to walk up?
-speak Liam
Is there a front door?
-speak Taliesin
Perhaps you should, before you do anything.
Just try and walk up.
-speak Matt
From what you can see, There appears to be a large, almost like beachwood, Light wood double door in the front of the compound.
-speak Laura
Grog's gonna go.
-speak Liam
I'm gonna use my rogue abilities to walk up to the front door, and knock on it.
-speak Orion
Great.
-speak Laura
Sorry Grog.
-speak Travis
I have one job.
To take damage.
-speak Liam
Can I see if I detect a bell?
-speak Marisha
Is that a talent you picked, is that a feat?
-speak Matt
So, you walk towards the grass.
You step onto the walkway that leads towards the front of the building.
As soon as you cross into the threshold where those stone sigils are, you make a dexterity saving throw.
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Laura
Oh no.
Roll well, my brother.
-speak Liam
This is really not good for their business.
(LIAM and LAURA groan)
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Liam
12.
-speak Matt
12.
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Matt
So, as you pull your cloak around you and take a few steps to jaunt upwards, suddenly there's, you guys hear it.
The strange
-narrate
(tongue clicking)
-speak Matt
sound, and a poof, poof of arcane blue energy kind of, just pulses around his feet.
You instinctively begin to pull back, but as you do, there's a blast of blue electric energy that
-narrate
(imitates explosion)
-speak Matt
, streaks out from all around you, shocking your body and throwing you about 15 feet back, straight onto your shoulders.
You
-narrate
(imitates grinding)
-speak Matt
skid to a halt
-narrate
(imitates thud)
-speak Matt
.
-speak Liam
Which one of these do I roll for damage?
-speak Travis
Electrified sound effect.
-speak Matt
You take.
.
.
-speak Liam
Higigigigi!
-speak Matt
14 points of lightning damage.
-speak Liam
All right.
-speak Orion
This is as I'm paused telling him not to do that.
-speak Matt
Yes.
-speak Orion
Don't!
-speak Travis
Should've let me go.
-speak Matt
Your muscles eventually relax.
-speak Orion
As I was about to say, that was going to happen.
-speak Travis
We have a flying carpet.
-speak Laura
Hey, we have a flying carpet!
We have a flying carpet.
-speak Orion
Let me try one thing that I didn't think to do last time.
I'm gonna cast Dispel Magic on the runestone.
-speak Liam
Don't tase me, bro.
-speak Matt
Okay.
Go ahead and--
-speak Travis
It's really not that bad.
-speak Matt
Let's see.
-speak Laura
Pull it out.
-speak Travis
What?
-speak Laura
Pull out the flying--
-speak Marisha
Phrasing.
-speak Sam
Going for the handbook.
-speak Matt
Yeah, so we know what's going on.
-speak Travis
Oh, the magic carpet, hold on.
-speak Sam
Guys, don't forget to subscribe to Geek and Sundry.
-speak Laura
Oh yeah!
-speak Orion
Oh, and I cast it at my fourth level slot.
-speak Travis
You wanna fly it up to the door?
-speak Marisha
What are you casting?
-speak Orion
Dispel magic.
-speak Matt
All right, make an arcana check.
-speak Laura
It can't carry you, you're too heavy.
-speak Travis
I said you, not me.
-speak Laura
Oh, gimme that flying carpet.
-speak Travis
That's what I said.
-speak Orion
13.
-speak Matt
13?
-speak Orion
Yeah.
-speak Matt
Okay.
As you concentrate and these kind of shimmering bands of arcane energy wave off your hands toward the enchantment, they impact and dissipate without effect.
-speak Orion
Are they fourth level or higher?
-speak Matt
They seem to be.
-speak Orion
Fuck.
-speak Laura
I hop on the flying carpet.
-speak Matt
Okay, so you pull the flying carpet, Mary Poppins-style, out of the bag of holding.
-narrate
(imitates soft thud)
-speak Laura
Yes.
And see if I can fly up and over to the door.
-speak Travis
Do you wanna tie a rope around your waist in case it goes bad?
-speak Orion
It's a flying magical carpet.
-speak Laura
Somebody.
Oh.
Is that bad?
Is that a bad idea?
-speak Travis
No, do it.
-speak Orion
It's a flying magical carpet.
-speak Sam
What could go wrong?
-speak Marisha
I think you'll just, like, hit a wall.
-speak Laura
What if the flying carpet gets ruined?
-speak Sam
Let's not do that then.
-speak Travis
Oh my God, really?
-speak Liam
It's not gonna be ruined.
-speak Marisha
Wait, wait, wait, I'm in squirrel form.
So I go out.
-speak Laura
Oh, and you're with me.
Let's both fly to the door.
-speak Liam
I have nine healing potions--
-speak Sam
Hey, hold on, hold on.
-speak Travis
What what, you turned invisible and walked inside a house last time.
-speak Sam
Yeah, I can do whatever we want.
Do you want me to knock on the door, is that what we're trying to do?
-speak Laura
Oh yeah, use your--
-speak Sam
Okay, so yes.
I send an unseen servant to knock on the door.
-speak Travis
What kind, like a buddy?
-speak Laura
Oh, he tried it before.
-speak Matt
Where do you create the unseen servant?
-speak Sam
Where do I create it?
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Sam
Right on the doorknocker.
Like, hanging on the doorknocker.
-speak Travis
Feet touching the ground?
-speak Matt
All right.
So the distance unseen servant can be summoned--
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Matt
I believe you may be able to actually summon it within the boundary of those arcane sigils.
-speak Travis
I'm just sitting back here holding the carpet.
♫ I can show you the world ♫
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
60 feet, so yeah.
You go ahead and you walk up to where that sigil is, you finish your spell, you cast unseen servant.
-speak Sam
♫ Unseen servant, ho ♫
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Which he says every time.
-speak Sam
Yes.
-speak Matt
Every single time.
You see this strange shift of air as some sort of humanoid form then materializes in the opposite side of this boundary and stands at your ready and command.
-speak Sam
We still haven't knocked on the door, correct?
GROUP: No.
-speak Matt
It's about a 60 foot walk.
-speak Sam
I command the unseen servant to
-narrate
(imitates knocking)
-speak Matt
It kind of saunters over.
You guys see this kind of shifting, barely, barely visible form make its way up to the front door.
In the distance, you hear a dull
-narrate
(knocking)
-speak Matt
.
Eventually, the door slightly opens.
And you see a hunched figure with bright white, chalk-white hair, kind of look out the doorway,
-speak Matt
Oh, where's he come from?
-speak Matt
Looking at the form in front of him.
-speak Sam
Oh, the ghost.
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Matt
That's where you come from.
All right.
-speak Sam
Hello!
-speak Orion
I'm waving.
Hello.
-speak Matt
Opens the door, comes out.
You now see this dwarven figure hunched, very, very old, with a long, very, very well-crafted brass staff, looks like a black or purple gem at the top.
Spectacles at the tip of its nose.
And it begins to kind of shift its way over towards you.
-narrate
(breathes heavily)
-speak Orion
Watch out for that rune.
It's still on.
-speak Sam
I think he knows that.
-narrate
(laughing)
-speak Matt
Eventually making its way.
-speak Travis
He's coming towards us?
-speak Matt
Yes.
Walks right to the edge of the sigil.
Puts his hand up, and the unseen servant vanishes.
He goes, 
-speak Matt
So, you have my attention.
-speak Orion
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
My name's Tiberius Stormwind, and these are my friends.
-speak Matt
He puts his hand up and there's no sound coming out of your mouth.
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Sam
Maybe we should listen.
-speak Matt
This is the one who would-be attacked our home abode not more than a few hours ago.
-speak Sam
He has emotional problems.
-speak Matt
Apparently.
He needs to learn respect for other people's property.
-speak Laura
Yes, he does.
-speak Liam
We agree wholeheartedly.
He's dragonborn, he's weird.
He's a little weird.
We're sorry to interrupt.
I don't know, it's dinnertime, I think.
I don't know if you've heard yet, it just happened.
We just fought some sort of many-headed beast down at the mines, and Lord Greyspine is sending us in.
So before we go, we were sent here.
We were told you were the dwarf to speak to if we needed--
-speak Laura
To know about the magical entities.
-speak Liam
I think it was just to get shit.
-narrate
(Travis and Sam laugh)
-speak Liam
To get ready for those entities.
-speak Matt
If you're looking to but trinkets and magical oddities--
-speak Laura
Trinkets!
-speak Matt
You've come to the wrong place.
This is a house of study.
This is where hardworking dwarves of arcane persuasion put their lives towards pursuing--
-speak Travis
Say something!
-speak Matt
--the magical forms and fields that--
-speak Sam
And we have come to seek your knowledge.
-speak Matt
I'm sorry.
-speak Orion
That's what I'm trying to say is that I came here looking to ask about the arcane studies.
I'm extremely interested in that.
When I heard that your house Was the only one that was in that particular study, I was immensely intrigued.
I respect the arcane arts so much that it's, well, it's been my life.
And right now, we're in bit of a situation where we have to go slaughter a bunch of nasties in apparently one of your mines.
And we don't know the source.
And it appears to be of an extreme arcane nature of the dark sense, and I figured we could come to you for help and some kind of guidance.
And I will-- Scanlan, will you stop it!
And it appears that you very well know something that we could learn from, with all due respect, of course.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion check.
-speak Marisha
Holy shit.
What the fuck.
Breathe.
-speak Orion
11.
-speak Travis
God, what is with these rolls?
-speak Taliesin
We've been middling.
-speak Laura
Terrible rolls today.
-speak Matt
The dwarf gives you a disapproving brow shift and goes, 
-speak Matt
Look, I mean no disrespect.
But understand, this is a dwarven house of arcane practitioning and study.
Don't see any dwarves among ya.
I think our business here is concluded.
If you're looking to buy stuff, we produce and sell through the Value of Valor house of sale.
-speak Travis
Oh Tiberius, can't you become a dwarf?
-speak Taliesin
Of course, sir, we completely understand if you're not up to such a challenge.
It makes perfect sense, and we'll be more than happy to go and buy some wares somewhere else if this is too much for you.
-speak Matt
Bah!
Challenge.
-speak Orion
I will send you my associate.
The dwarf turns around and begins walking away with his staff.
-speak Laura
What a beautiful staff that is.
-speak Orion
I'm gonna cast Alter Self on myself to be a dwarf.
-speak Travis
And jump behind me, and act like you just--
-speak Laura
Actually sir, we do have a dwarf with us.
-speak Marisha
No wait wait wait!
Cast it on me!
I'm a squirrel in her pocket.
-speak Orion
Oh shit, I cast it on her instead.
-narrate
(loud thudding)
-speak Laura
We have a dwarf with us who wanted to actually say hello to--
-speak Travis
-narrate
(whispering)
-speak Travis
What's your dwarf name?
-speak Matt
Turns around.
Saunters back.
-speak Orion
Keyleth, where have you been?
-speak Marisha
I guess it's Keyleth.
-speak Matt
Looks at you.
-speak Travis
Keyleth Kraghammer.
-speak Sam
You better fucking speak dwarvish.
-speak Matt
Smiles for a second as he looks at you and goes, 
-speak Matt
Ah, how nice to meet you.
Where are you from?
-speak Marisha
-narrate
(bad Scottish accent)
-speak Marisha
Oh, hello.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Laura
Oh, shit.
-narrate
(Liam speaks in Swedish-accented gibberish)
-speak Sam
Ya, from Sweden.
-speak Travis
I'm gonna choke on a chip.
-narrate
(coughs)
-speak Marisha
Keyleth is not good at this.
-speak Liam
Roll with it player, roll with it.
-speak Marisha
I hail from the mountains up north.
-speak Orion
She had an accident on the way over here.
We were hoping maybe--
-speak Matt
Roll a persuasion roll with disadvantage.
-narrate
(all talking and laughing)
-speak Matt
You.
Roll with disadvantage.
-speak Liam
Let the dice act better than us tonight, please.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Travis
-narrate
(high-pitched voice)
-speak Travis
Oh, hello!
-speak Marisha
Wait, persuasion--I don't have--oh, wait.
I have a zero.
Eight.
-speak Matt
That's your first roll.
Now roll again.
-speak Marisha
Oh, I have advantage.
-speak Matt
No, you have disadvantage.
-speak Marisha
Oh, disadvantage.
So eight.
-speak Matt
"
-speak Marisha
And I've been practicing my Cornwall accent for five minutes.
Shit.
-speak Matt
He raises his hand, and the Alter Self spell dissipates.
Where stands Keyleth.
-speak Sam
Oh Keyleth, you've been lying to us this whole time?
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Orion
Who are you?
-speak Sam
We thought you were a dwarf.
-speak Liam
Vax steps forward, steps in front of Keyleth and says, Good sir dwarf.
Clearly we are idiots.
We are--
-speak Matt
That's the first true thing you've said since you've called me out of my home.
-speak Liam
Stay with me on this.
We are strangers in a strange land.
However, we are working with Lord Greyspine to empty your mines and end the evil that is spewing forth from them.
Now I know that we are a bit stupid--
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Liam
--in a number of ways.
-speak Laura
But we fight well.
-speak Liam
But we fight well, and we have the best of intentions, and when it counts, we're there.
We just need a little bit of help going into the mines.
And again, Lord Greyspine himself sent us, so please excuse my-- TALIESIN: Cornwall?
-speak Liam
--challenged friends.
-speak Travis
My cornhole friends.
-speak Liam
We're here to help.
I promise.
-speak Travis
That's a very Disney moment.
-speak Liam
Wink, wink, wink.
-speak Laura
I wink twice.
Make a persuasion roll at disadvantage.
-speak Laura
Can I assist him 'cause I winked?
-speak Matt
No.
-speak Laura
Damn it.
-speak Travis
It's a powerful wink.
-speak Matt
It's a powerful wink, but not this powerful.
Not the way this conversation's been going.
-speak Travis
Yeah, apparently not.
Oh hello!
-speak Liam
Best roll of the night.
I rolled a 20 and a 17.
So 19.
-speak Matt
19.
He glares at you two and goes, 
-speak Matt
I've said my piece.
Good luck to you all.
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Sam
Further.
-speak Laura
If you had gotten the 20.
-speak Liam
How about a chocolate-covered mallomar?
-speak Sam
I'm gonna have one more try at this.
-speak Matt
He turns around and starts walking away.
-speak Sam
There must be so many arcane things down there that we will discover and bring to you upon finding them.
-speak Laura
Good call, Scanlan.
-speak Sam
Things that you could use for your research.
Historical items.
-speak Matt
As he's still walking away, you hear him shout over his shoulder, 
-speak Matt
And when you bring them, then we'll talk!
-speak Sam
Okay, that's fair.
-speak Matt
Till then, good day, and don't bother me when I'm eating.
-speak Laura
Thank you, Lord Thunderclap.
-speak Liam
This game has consequences.
-speak Matt
At which he shouts again at a booming, booming prestidigitation voice, 
-speak Matt
It's THUNDERBRAND!
-speak Laura
That's what I meant.
-speak Matt
You hear the door slam, boom!
-speak Travis
That was fun.
-speak Sam
That was great!
-speak Laura
Should we go buy some potions then?
-speak Taliesin
Yes, let's go buy some potions.
-speak Sam
He gave us a little bit of information.
The valve of valva, what's it?
Valor of -
-speak Travis
Vulva?
-speak Sam
The place to place to go buy potions.
-speak Orion
The House of Valor.
-speak Sam
No, the valva--
-speak Orion
It's not the House of Vulva, Scanlan.
-speak Matt
The Value of Valor.
LAURA AND
-speak Sam
The Value of Valor!
-speak Travis
If you want to visit the House of Vulva, you and I can go later but not now.
-speak Laura
The Value of Valor, let's go find that.
-speak Orion
-narrate
(in Marisha's bad accent)
-speak Orion
Let's go to the North.
-speak Marisha
I'm sorry.
I didn't think about the fact that I was gonna have to do an accent.
I'm not good with that stuff.
-speak Laura
It's okay, Keyleth.
-speak Travis
Women, fighting, ale, that's my job.
-speak Matt
So after a bit of discussion, you manage to make your way around town.
You eventually find your way to the Value of Valor, which is a--
-speak Laura
Terrible.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Matt
It's a stone building.
Like reddish brick, it looks in construction.
With fine purple--
-speak Laura
Please be open, please be open, please be open.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Matt
Fine purple tapestries in the front that show various battles of old dwarven history of two glowing enchanted permalight lanterns hanging from the front.
-speak Taliesin
Classy.
-speak Matt
And an entryway that is currently open and a warmly-lit interior welcomes you.
-speak Travis
Awesome.
-speak Liam
So easy.
-speak Sam
Hey, before we go in there and just make asses of ourselves, As a group, what do you think we need to get down into these mines?
-speak Laura
Potions.
-speak Taliesin
Healing potions.
-speak Sam
Healing potions.
Some light sources--
-speak Orion
We don't need that.
-speak Sam
Climbing anything?
-speak Laura
I have climbing gear.
-speak Sam
I have some climbing gear, but--
-speak Laura
That's included in the dungeoneering kit, right?
-speak Matt
Yes.
-speak Sam
Oh, what about something for breathing?
-speak Sam
Like what if we get trapped down there with no air?
-speak Orion
Don't worry about that.
-speak Laura
She can make plants, and we'll get plenty of oxygen.
-speak Marisha
Oxygen's good, although if we have something to help with poison, that might be good.
Can we get some antidotes?
-speak Liam
Vex.
How much gold do we have at the moment?
-speak Laura
That is a wonderful question, brother.
-speak Orion
By the way, I pull out a bottle of air.
Just an empty bottle and go: and plus, we have this.
-speak Laura
We will more than double our gold if we take this mission.
-speak Travis
So we got like 24,000 gold pieces?
-speak Laura
Less than that.
-speak Travis
23 thousand.
-speak Laura
Less than that.
-speak Travis
22 thousand?
-speak Liam
More than double, that means it could be one thousand.
'Cause anything is more than double.
-speak Laura
I don't like sharing.
-speak Travis
Math is stupid.
-speak Sam
All right, we go into the House of Vulva.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Sam
Open your vulva!
-speak Matt
That's not what it's called.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Travis
Are you sure you don't wanna think about renaming it now?
-speak Matt
It's the Value of Valor guys, come on!
-narrate
(whines)
-speak Matt
All right, so.
-speak Taliesin
You're tearing the party apart.
-speak Liam
Tearing me apart, Lisa.
-speak Matt
A giant boulder falls out of nowhere and crushes Grog.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
So you make your way inside.
Suddenly, hit with the smell of heavy incense and jasmine.
This is the equivalent of a Psychic Eye Bookshop.
-speak Orion
Groovy!
-speak Marisha
Oh, we were just there.
-speak Taliesin
We were just there.
-speak Travis
Nag champa.
-speak Matt
You walk inside.
There's not a lot of folks inside looking about the establishment.
But there is one person sitting at the front desk, which is a beautiful long oak table with a red trim that hangs to the ceiling.
Not a dwarf, actually.
What you see there appears to be an elven individual, sitting at wait, hair pulled back behind the ears.
Very, very slight, thin build.
And smiles as you enter and says, 
-speak Matt
Welcome to my establishment, may I help you?
-speak Laura
We both stand a little taller, and try to look more noble.
-speak Liam
Hello.
-speak Matt
Yes.
-speak Liam
It's a beautiful shop you have.
It's so startling to find an elven establishment here in the middle of Kraghammer.
How did this come about?
-speak Matt
Well.
They didn't have one.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(Travis and Sam laugh)
-speak Matt

-speak Matt
And I found there was perhaps money to be made in starting one.
I've been here for over a hundred years.
-speak Travis
Oh sh-- Are you guys that old?
-speak Liam
No, we are not.
-speak Orion
So business is good?
-speak Matt
Dwarves have a hard time buying from those who are not dwarves.
But I've made my established connections with business individuals.
So, what can I help you with?
-speak Taliesin
We're in the market for some healing potions to start with.
-speak Travis
Yep, yep.
-speak Matt
Of which intensity are you looking for?
-speak Matt
So looking for a superior healing potion.
-speak Travis
Yeah, superior.
-speak Matt
I've only got two of those currently.
-speak Laura
They're expensive, Grog.
-speak Marisha
We don't have Pike, though.
-speak Matt
I can sell you the two superior healing potions.
-speak Marisha
I'm still not feeling well.
-speak Matt
Those will run you 1,500 gold pieces each.
-speak Travis
Fuck!
Really?
!
-speak Taliesin
This is why you buy medium healing potions.
-speak Marisha
On second thought, I'll just read some books tonight,
-speak Travis
I take damage fast.
-speak Marisha
Refresh myself on my healing spells.
-speak Laura
Can I ask your name?
-speak Matt
He gives you a keen look and says, 
-speak Matt
Tremaine.
-speak Laura
Tremaine.
-speak Travis
Oh, here we go.
-narrate
(Liam and Taliesin laugh)
-speak Marisha
It's what she's good at.
-speak Travis
Everybody take five while we haggle.
-speak Laura
I'm just saying.
We're heading into the mines.
We are going to encounter very many arcane objects potentially.
In fact, Lord Thunderbrand sent us over here.
That's his name, right?
-speak Travis
You got it.
-speak Taliesin
You did it right.
-speak Laura
Sent us over here telling us to find his wares here.
And we've made a deal with him that if we find arcane objects we could potentially, you know, I lost track of what I was saying, but you get the idea.
-speak Sam
Oh boy.
-speak Orion
What would you suggest?
And do you know of any things we should particularly buy before we leave going into the mines and encountering nasty naga-type creatures and other kind of things.
-speak Matt
Superior healing potions.
-speak Travis
How much are they each, 1,500?
-speak Matt
1,500 gold pieces.
-speak Travis
I'll take one for me, thank you.
-speak Matt
Very well.
-speak Laura
We'll very much like to perhaps make a deal with you, that we'll bring you objects of arcane nature for a discount on your wares.
-speak Matt
Make a persuasion roll.
-speak Travis
Oh shit.
I just paid for--
-speak Laura
Oh, no you didn't.
Not yet.
-speak Liam
Roll, sister.
-speak Laura
Oh, come on, no whammies, no whammies.
Okay, well.
15, hm?
-speak Travis
He's an old elf.
-speak Matt
He says, 
-speak Matt
And I appreciate this perhaps offer.
Once you return from your mines--
-speak Laura
I know, I know, I know.
-speak Matt
--with these magical accoutrements, you are more than welcome to bring them here, and we'll make a deal.
-speak Laura
How many dragons have you come across, sir?
Are you interested in dragon parts?
-speak Travis
Oh, we have a lot of dragon bits.
-speak Matt
He extends his hand to a shelf on the side labeled, 
-speak Matt
Dragon Parts.
-speak Laura
Oh.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Laura
Lovely.
-speak Matt
And to answer your question, three.
-speak Laura
Oh, really?
-speak Travis
What about basilisk eggs?
-speak Laura
What kind of dragons, actually?
-speak Matt
What was your question, sir?
-speak Travis
We have also, if you're interested in trade, basilisk eggs and parts of an umber hulk.
-speak Liam
And a troll dick.
-speak Travis
No, that's gone.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Travis
We flogged him with it and then it disappeared.
-speak Liam
I detract my offer.
-speak Travis
It was used very well.
-speak Matt
He gives you a very concerned look.
-speak Travis
I'm a collector of sorts.
-speak Matt
Both of you.
And he goes, And he goes, 
-speak Matt
I work in trade, meaning gold pieces for my wares.
-speak Laura
Yes.
-speak Matt
If you have interest, purchase.
If not, I have other business to attend to.
-speak Sam
Any other healing potions to buy?
Come on people.
-speak Laura
Maybe a moderate.
-speak Liam
All right, well friends, we're about to descend into hell itself, so I reckon we should probably pay the price.
-speak Taliesin
Two moderates.
-speak Matt
Greater.
In the new edition.
-speak Taliesin
Greater.
-speak Marisha
How much are the greaters?
-speak Matt
The greater healing potions run 300 gold apiece.
-speak Laura
Oh, let's get a few of those.
-speak Travis
I need like three of those.
-speak Matt
So, three?
-speak Travis
Yeah, three.
-speak Laura
Do you have any arrows that--
-speak Travis
Well let's do the potions first.
-speak Laura
Okay okay okay, two for me.
-speak Matt
So, five.
-speak Taliesin
Two for me as well.
-speak Matt
Seven.
-speak Travis
Keyleth.
-speak Marisha
I'll take one.
-speak Matt
Eight.
-speak Travis
Tiberius?
-speak Matt
Anyone else require a moderate healing potion?
-speak Travis
Tiberius?
-speak Orion
I could take one.
-speak Matt
Pathfinder to 5E.
-speak Travis
Scanlan?
-speak Sam
Well, do we have ours leftover from what we had before?
LAURA, TRAVIS, MATT: Yes.
-speak Sam
Then I'm fine.
-speak Travis
Vax?
-speak Laura
He's Vax.
-speak Liam
No, I'm good actually.
-speak Laura
He's Vax.
-speak Travis
Oh, my intelligence is six.
-speak Liam
I'm so fast I don't really use them that much.
-speak Travis
So nine.
-speak Liam
You'll get to that point as well.
-speak Laura
Nine potions then.
-speak Travis
Nine times 300, work that out.
-speak Matt
As he pulls up his arcane calculator.
-speak Laura
So 2,500 for all nine then.
-speak Taliesin
It's an abacus, God, abacus!
-speak Travis
I believe it's 2,700 gold pieces?
-speak Laura
Why would you do that?
I was trying to make him--
-speak Matt
It is 27.
-speak Matt
"
-speak Travis
It's Professor Grog, actually.
-speak Orion
All right, calm down.
-speak Matt
2,700 gold pieces for your nine greater healing potions.
-speak Laura
All right, 27.
Do you have any arrows that perhaps have magical properties?
-speak Orion
Enchanted arrows is what she's asking for.
-speak Laura
Yes.
-speak Matt
He kind of glances over his shoulder and says, 
-speak Matt
Ah, we haven't had much a request for arrows in a while.
We have bolts for crossbows, as that seems to be the staple for the carvers of the city.
I have two sleep arrows, perhaps, if that is of interest to you.
-speak Orion
Yes they would be, very much.
-speak Laura
And what would you charge for those, sir?
-speak Taliesin
Ooh, I should build some interesting arrows.
-speak Marisha
You should.
-speak Matt
Arrows.
-narrate
(whispering and muttering)
-speak Matt
That would run you 250 gold per arrow.
I have two currently.
-speak Laura
All right, all right, I'll take 'em.
-speak Matt
All right, 500 gold.
With that, that is a total of 3,200 gold pieces.
-speak Travis
Scanlan, underwater breathing or air, oxygen supplies?
-speak Orion
Dear sir, have you happened upon any--
-speak Travis
Ask with your fancy talk.
-speak Orion
--relic or artifact around here, or heard of something called the Pale Stone?
-speak Laura
Sorry, you have to watch us buy things.
-speak Orion
This is a rare artifact I've been looking for for quite some time.
-speak Orion
I figured an environment like this might lend to something.
-speak Laura
What is it a mess you've made?
-speak Matt
I don't believe I have, but should you come across one, I would be interested to have a look.
-speak Orion
Oh, you appraise?
-speak Matt
If you don't mind.
-speak Orion
Very good.
-speak Sam
And do you have anything for adventuring underwater or for helping to breathe in tight spaces?
-speak Matt
Mm, potion of waterbreathing, I do happen to have.
-speak Sam
A potion of waterbreathing?
-speak Matt
Yes, I do.
-speak Sam
How much?
-speak Matt
I have four of them available, and they run 500 gold apiece.
-speak Sam
Jesus.
-speak Travis
We'll take it.
We got all this platinum I forgot about.
-speak Sam
Take one, two, one?
-speak Laura
Don't say that!
-speak Travis
He can't hear--
-speak Orion
I don't need one.
I bring out my bottle of air.
And I go, 
-speak Matt
I have this.
-speak Matt
And I put it back in.
-speak Sam
I'm okay as well.
You want one, Grog?
-speak Travis
Yeah.
-speak Sam
All right, we'll just take one of those.
-speak Travis
Just one?
-speak Sam
Well, I don't need it.
He doesn't need it.
-speak Travis
We'll take two.
-speak Sam
Two.
-speak Matt
1,000 gold.
That brings us to 42,00 gold.
-speak Laura
Wait, 42?
-speak Matt
Yes.
-speak Liam
Have you any elven gear for a son of Syngorn?
-speak Laura
Are you taking it off of your pot now?
-speak Travis
Yep.
-speak Matt
He gives you a keen look and goes, 
-speak Matt
We don't get many requests for this, but I think this may fit you.
-speak Matt
And he reaches below and pulls up a fine piece of mithril chain, elven in make.
-speak Laura
That's what I'm wearing.
-speak Matt
Mm hm.
-speak Travis
Show-off.
-speak Matt
He says, 
-speak Matt
Would you perhaps be interested in this elven chain?
-speak Liam
It's beautiful.
I am a bit of a light-footed one.
Would it suit me?
-speak Matt
Hm.
Chain does make a bit of a racket.
Might not recommend it, unfortunately.
-speak Liam
All right.
I'll pass.
-speak Travis
You couldn't buy it for me?
-speak Laura
It won't fit you, it's for elves.
-speak Liam
You're gigantic.
-speak Travis
Could go on my pinky or something.
-speak Laura
All right, cool.
-speak Liam
Could fit on your left nut.
-speak Laura
Well, thanks.
-speak Travis
That's an important nut.
-speak Matt
He goes ahead and accepts your gold.
Go ahead and mark off 4,200 gold for those.
-speak Laura
I did already.
-speak Matt
All right, very well.
-speak Matt
Thank you for your patronage.
I look forward to hopefully having you back when you return with whatever artifacts you manage to find.
-speak Travis
Thank you, you're very nice.
-speak Laura
Big expensive artifacts.
-speak Taliesin
I say, you're one of the most charming people we've met so far down here.
-speak Travis
And it smells pretty in here.
-speak Matt
Well of course, they come in rare ordinance in this city, it seems.
-speak Travis
Do we sleep before we get to go kill shit?
-speak Taliesin
We're gonna go sleep.
-speak Travis
Well can we go do that?
-speak Laura
Let's go sleep and then get up in the morning and go down and kill things.
-speak Taliesin
And I'd love to do a crafting roll right before I go to sleep just to put together a little thing.
-speak Matt
What would you like to put together?
-speak Taliesin
I'd like to try and build a bolo arrow, a trapping arrow.
-speak Travis
Yeah!
-speak Matt
Interesting, okay.
As you guys head back to the inn where you've rented rooms for the week,
-speak Travis
You clever fucker.
-speak Matt
Which would be at the Iron Hearth Tavern.
-speak Travis
Is Ballsack in there?
When we walk in?
-speak Matt
Balgus is not in the tavern, no.
-speak Travis
He's not?
-speak Orion
He's Balgus, Grog.
-speak Matt
No, sorry.
-speak Travis
Really?
-speak Matt
He's got a home.
-speak Travis
Yeah, but doesn't mean he have to go to it.
-speak Matt
True.
-speak Laura
I walk Trinket down into the storage area that he can stay in.
-speak Matt
(bear noise)
Trinket goes down begrudgingly.
-speak Orion
Damn it.
-speak Laura
I look around for something that can look like a pillow for him.
-speak Matt
You find a couple of sacks of grain that can probably work.
-speak Laura
I put them down and make them comfy for him.
-speak Matt
Okay, you think they're probably not gonna last the night with those bear claws.
But you don't care, it's not your grain.
-speak Laura
That's fine.
Also, I feed him.
-speak Matt
Okay, Trinket is very happy.
-narrate
(imitates bear eating)
-speak Matt
Tears into some meat.
You guys make it back to the tavern for an evening's rest.
For you--
-speak Taliesin
Not a super complicated thing, but, you know, I've gotta--
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make a Tinker's Kit roll.
-speak Taliesin
What am I rolling with my Tinker's Kit?
I've never done this before.
-speak Matt
For this, I would go ahead and make it an intellect modifier to your roll.
-speak Taliesin
Intellect modifier?
-speak Travis
Rock that shit, Perce.
-speak Taliesin
And I'm spending my bonus die as well.
-speak Laura
Oh, we have bonus die, don't we?
From Scanlan.
-speak Taliesin
Thank God, because I rolled really badly.
10.
-speak Matt
10?
You spend and toil away for the next four or so hours trying to find a way to get this trigger to work.
Twice you nearly sprain a finger.
You manage seemingly get it to function, then the arrow itself splits and shatters.
You can see there being something to it, but this night it's not gonna come to you.
-speak Taliesin
I'm gonna have to try again later.
Okay, that's fine.
It's on the list.
That was a terrible roll.
-speak Matt
It was a terrible roll.
-speak Marisha
It's been a bad day for rolls.
It's been bad day for rolling.
-speak Laura
Fresh start in the morning.
-speak Sam
Well, tomorrow is the day that it counts, because that's when we begin to crack some heads.
-speak Laura
When we could die.
-speak Taliesin
Out with this system, new dice.
-speak Marisha
To be fair, it's been a long day.
I'm still bleeding everywhere.
-speak Sam
Should we rest and get on with it?
-speak Laura
Let's do it!
-speak Sam
Or should we visit some whorehouses?
-speak Travis
Nah, let's sleep.
-speak Sam
Let's just sleep tonight.
-speak Laura
Just sleep and go.
-speak Travis
Oh, they're still tired from the other night.
-speak Sam
Oh yes, one of them battered me quite--
-speak Travis
I don't know what this is.
-speak Sam
That's me getting beaten up by a whore dwarf.
-speak Travis
Oh, it's you getting the elbow drop.
-speak Travis
She's giving you the Randy Savage from the bedpost.
-speak Travis
Oh yeah!
-narrate
(crosstalk)
-speak Travis
We're sleeping now.
-speak Matt
All right.
So you guys go to sleep.
Wake up the next morning fully healed, spells restored, well rested and ready for the day.
You think it's day.
It's hard to tell.
Still, this underground circumstance is really messing with you guys.
-speak Sam
Well, should we go plunder some mines and kill some goblins?
-speak Laura
Let's do it.
-speak Taliesin
Let's go plunder some mines.
-speak Travis
So we head down to the mines.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Travis
To the hole.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Travis
♫ Takin' it to the hole ♫
-speak Matt
You make your way down to the bottom ring of Kraghammer.
To the mines proper.
The miners have gone back to work, and from what you can see, there's just an all around crazy business with people cleaning out, still trying to clean out the ichor that's on the ground left over from the battle you guys had the day before.
You make your way to the front of the mines, and immediately three of the carvers that are standing at the front approach as you begin to walk, and then upon noticing you, kind of like, step back and put their weapons to the side.
-speak Travis
Yep.
-speak Matt
Acknowledging the orders they received from Lord Greyspine.
-speak Laura
Oh, Trinket's with us.
-speak Matt
Trinket has come along with you.
-speak Sam
Trinket the bear, Trinket the bear.
-speak Laura
I just saw that, don't forget Trinket.
I didn't forget Trinket.
-speak Matt
I assume Trinket comes with you unless you say otherwise.
-speak Matt
In general.
-speak Travis
Are they especially bowing to Scanlan the snake slayer?
-speak Matt
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Matt
No.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Travis
No love!
-speak Matt
They're busy working.
-speak Matt
And fair play to the gnome, but they're dwarves.
-speak Sam
Sure.
-speak Orion
Yeah.
They see that crap all the time.
-speak Matt
You make your way into the mine proper.
It goes back for a good 10 minutes of walking and of winding.
You can see the actual track of the minetrack leading around.
You come upon a couple of dwarves that look over their shoulders begrudgingly at you guys as you pass going, 
-speak Matt
Hey?
Eh, shh,
-speak Matt
and go right back into mining whatever remains in the inside of this.
It looks like this portion of the mine has been nearly picked clean.
The dwarves that are in there are probably just wasting time to get their pay for the day.
You go further back and eventually it opens up.
I think I have the map available.
-speak Liam
I've got it right here.
-speak Sam
It's over there.
-speak Matt
Cool.
-speak Sam
Can you put it so that the people can see?
-speak Laura
Oh, yeah.
-speak Sam
Is that a thing?
-speak Travis
They can't see that.
-speak Matt
We can put it on there perhaps.
For the most part I'll be describing it as you go, so it's not too important.
-speak Laura
Okay.
-speak Taliesin
Looks like Italy.
-speak Matt
Yes.
-speak Travis
It's a boot.
-speak Marisha
It's the boot, yeah.
-speak Matt
Following it, you get to a portion of the mine that is very busy.
You can see, since this is probably one of the portions that wasn't collapsed in previous incursions buy whatever creatures these were, you get the feeling that this one has basically taken most of their workforce to try and find and carve a new vein.
Or find a new path to pull things from.
You get towards the portion where all these dwarves are working, and you notice that some of the doors have been shattered, knocked off the hinges.
You imagine whatever creatures were barreling through before, this is probably where they came through.
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Taliesin
That's where we're going.
-speak Travis
Make an arcane check.
Somebody with arcane.
-speak Laura
Oh yeah, can I look around?
Perception.
-speak Matt
You look around.
What are you looking for?
-speak Laura
I'm looking for, you know.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Travis
Be specific.
-speak Taliesin
15 arcana check.
-speak Laura
Scratch marks for anything.
-speak Marisha
I like the idea of magic perception.
-speak Taliesin
I just wanna see if there's anything familiar about the markings, if I can identify any signs of something mystical that's come through here.
-speak Travis
Like a portal or a prison or a--
-speak Matt
That'd be more of an investigation roll.
-speak Taliesin
Oh, well, alright.
-speak Laura
I'm gonna look for tracks.
-speak Matt
Okay.
That'll be an investigation roll for you as well.
-speak Marisha
I'm gonna assist her, look for animal tracks.
-speak Laura
I'm scared, I don't know which one to roll.
Both my die have been rolling so bad.
-speak Orion
I want to detect magic for a while.
-speak Matt
All right.
-narrate
(loud thud)
-speak Matt
Aid roll, Keyleth?
-speak Laura
This one is no longer in service.
-speak Taliesin
Oh, wow!
-speak Marisha
Five.
-speak Travis
Well hers is a lot better.
-speak Marisha
Good.
-speak Liam
Sorry, I've got the map, so I'm looking at the mine.
Are we still in the dwarven carved out, sort of structure portion of the mine.
-speak Matt
You are.
You have just essentially started on that map.
-speak Sam
So let's go down.
-speak Liam
Guys, I'm holding a map.
I see one room that they've scrawled 
-speak Matt
Supply
-speak Matt
on, so it should be the next right up ahead.
I'd like to just take a peek in there and see what we can see before we head deeper in.
-speak Matt
All right, you are--?
-speak Laura
I rolled a one again.
-speak Matt
A natural one.
-speak Laura
A natural one.
Vax and I get dressed up in Sherlock Holmes cosplay, and we say, 
-speak Matt
Golly gee, I think I see some animal tracks over here.
-speak Taliesin
They are staring at their own footprints on the ground.
-speak Marisha
The trail's going cold!
-speak Taliesin
Following around in a circle.
-speak Matt
Oh man, this has turned completely back from the first game.
You guys are failing consistently.
-speak Laura
Everything.
-speak Matt
Let's turn this around, let's turn this around.
-speak Liam
Anyhow, I've got a map, so let's use this.
Stay on point here.
-speak Matt
You make your way towards the supply room as you head to where it was.
One of the dwarves is guarding it.
Not a carver, just one of the miners that was hired for this purpose is standing there.
Leads you into the door, kind of opening it for you, awkwardly going, 
-speak Matt
All right, whatever you're looking for, fine.
Go inside.
-speak Matt
Looking inside, there are just racks and racks and racks of pickaxes, shovels, utensils for the purpose of mining and constructing.
There are wooden boards lying down.
There are just giant barrels of nails and clipping utensils, and things that are used in the continuous expansion of a mine.
-speak Liam
I've seen enough.
We should keep going.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Liam
This map says that there's an elevator a short ways up.
-speak Laura
That goes down.
-speak Liam
That goes down.
But then there's a railway that goes further in into the caves, so I'm not sure.
-speak Laura
We should probably go down.
-speak Marisha
Yeah, I feel like going down.
-speak Liam
Elevator straight down?
-speak Marisha
Let's go further, all the way down.
-speak Sam
How many of us can the elevator hold?
-speak Matt
Elevator can pretty much hold all of you guys.
-speak Sam
Okay, let's go.
-speak Liam
It's a safe assumption that Lady Kima did not just walk to the back of the upper floors, she probably went down.
-speak Sam
Yeah, let's go down, come on!
-speak Liam
Get shit done, let's go.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Laura
Let's do it.
-speak Marisha
Get low.
-speak Travis
Air high five.
-speak Liam
We have a map to the elevator.
-speak Travis
Make 10.
-speak Matt
As you guys are walking over to where the elevator is, you do notice there are two places in the mines where there is just large piles of rubble.
And part of the ceiling has collapsed.
You can see that there were portions where the mine expanded much deeper into the mountain that were detonated or collapsed in the idea of preventing any further incursion by whatever these creatures are pouring through.
You also can see that there are some dwarven corpses being loaded out from the mine below, as well as goblin corpses, individuals that were caught in the attack that happened yesterday before it managed to emerge from the mine.
-speak Liam
Scanlan, are you all right around these goblin corpses?
-speak Laura
We should follow those.
-speak Sam
Any goblin corpse is a good goblin, I say.
I'm fine with it.
I'll just quickly spit on their bodies as they go by.
-speak Matt
And you do so quite quickly
-narrate
(spits)
-speak Matt
.
It's rapid, it's amazing.
-speak Laura
So we follow the corpses and see where they're coming from.
-speak Matt
All right.
So that heads away from the elevator.
-speak Sam
No no no, no no no.
That's being taken to be buried, let's just keep--
-speak Laura
No no no, where they're coming from.
-speak Sam
Oh.
-speak Liam
So we could either go to the rear of the mine on this level and see where they're coming from.
-speak Laura
I thought we already went downstairs?
-speak Liam
No, not yet.
-speak Matt
There's a spiral staircase on the map.
On the lower right hand side.
-speak Liam
Yes, I see it.
-speak Matt
That's where they're coming from.
-speak Laura
Does that lead down probably?
-speak Matt
It seems to.
-speak Laura
Well then let's take the elevator, whatever.
Let's go down.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Travis
You should put it under the thing.
-speak Taliesin
We're good with down.
-speak Matt
You guys go ahead and approach the elevator.
It's a large wooden platform with a series of chains.
My terrible, hastily drawn map there for you.
-speak Travis
It's kinda crap, but it's kinda great.
-speak Matt
Yeah, I know.
It was actually more designed as a DM utensil, but you guys needed a map--
-speak Travis
I love it.
-speak Matt
--so I gave you my map.
-speak Travis
There you go.
-speak Laura
Take it back.
-speak Matt
So I'm taking it back.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Orion
Give it to me.
-speak Matt
It's-a mine.
No, I'm keeping it.
It's all right.
So you get back to the elevator.
There's a large 15 by 20 platform with a series of chains and there are two dwarves in the back that run a giant iron wheel.
As you approach, they kind of give you a look, like, 
-speak Matt
Well, are you serious about going down?
-speak Matt
(Travis, Laura, and Marisha)
Yeah.
-speak Matt
Okay, step on the platform.
-speak Laura
Let's do it.
The two dwarves grab and begin to rotate the giant wheel, as it does you here the winch and the chain begin to tighten as it does.
The platform shudders for a second, begins to lower.
As it begins to lower, you can feel the actual platform shake a little bit as the whole weight is placed on the chains.
-speak Taliesin
Guys.
We're on an elevator.
-speak Marisha
This is scary.
-speak Orion
I love elevators.
-speak Matt
As the winch begins to release, it--
-speak Laura
I pet Trinket, calm him down.
-speak Marisha
I've never been on one of these before.
-speak Matt
Trinket is a little nervous.
-speak Marisha
It's really tight.
-speak Taliesin
I'm on an elevator with a bear.
-speak Marisha
It's really dark, tight.
-speak Orion
Oh, light!
-narrate
(snaps)
-speak Taliesin
Thank you.
-speak Laura
Are we down yet?
-speak Marisha
Keyleth's getting a little claustrophobic.
She's never been in this tight of a space.
-speak Travis
Are you claustrophobic?
-speak Matt
As the light spell bursts out from his staff.
You all kind of have to cover your eyes for a second.
But the lower area is opened up.
-speak Liam
Word of warning, Tiberius.
-speak Laura
Can we see out?
-speak Orion
She said it was dark, and then I cast my spell.
-speak Travis
Yeah, it's what you do.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(imitates loud thudding)
-speak Matt
You guys hit the bottom floor.
You step off the platform, and you can see there is a secondary minecart that leads from this elevator that curves to the left and leads deeper into the mine proper.
To the right of you is the spiral staircase.
And you can see now two of the other miner dwarves are dragging a dead body across.
-speak Laura
Can I look for goblin tracks down here and follow those?
-speak Matt
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Matt
You can attempt another investigation check.
-speak Sam
Why don't we just ask the dwarves where they were getting the bodies?
-speak Travis
You're gonna roll crap.
You're gonna roll crap.
-speak Laura
Don't curse me.
-speak Marisha
Please don't do that.
-speak Laura
What am I, what is it?
That I add it to?
-speak Matt
Investigate.
-speak Laura
Perception?
-speak Matt
Investigate.
But you advantage on the roll, because you're a ranger, tracking.
-speak Laura
Oh sweet.
Okay.
-speak Sam
Why don't we just ask?
-speak Laura
Well that's good, okay.
Let's go with a 17.
-speak Matt
17, alright.
So as you guys are going to ask somebody about this, your ranger gets down and begins inspecting the floor.
-speak Laura
Yeah, I see things!
-speak Matt
Where you can see there were struggles that apparently occurred.
You can see slash marks on the ground.
You can see bodies, or the impacts of bodies where some of these dwarves have been pulled away.
A few minutes later, you can see tracks, dwarven tracks, of bodies being pulled and dragged, not in the direction they're going, but further down the tunnel.
-speak Travis
Yeah, let's go there.
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-speak Matt
As you look and follow that track, you notice that maybe a good 200 feet to the left of the cavern, there is a new tunnel breach that is currently open.
About a 20 by 15 size tunnel that is fresh and blasted out from the other side.
You can see rubble and rocks strewn across the floor.
-speak Laura
I hear, I hear birds coming from the--
-speak Travis
It's a fucking trip, right?
-speak Laura
I know.
-speak Sam
Let's go down there.
Let's go down where it's dangerous.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Laura
Can we see?
-speak Travis
Can we ask one of the guards?
-speak Taliesin
It's a mine canary.
-speak Liam
Is it black or is it dim?
-speak Matt
With his light spell, it's fairly bright.
-speak Travis
Nice!
-speak Matt
Otherwise, it's fairly dim.
-speak Travis
I cup my hands over my face and go, Grog, Grog, Grog.
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Matt
And it does echo.
Grog, Grog, Grog, Grog.
-speak Laura
Why would you do that?
-speak Travis
Why not?
-speak Matt
-narrate
(faintly)
-speak Matt
Grog-Grog.
Grog.
Following the tracks, you can see the dragging of the bodies does indeed go in the direction, and into the newly carved tunnel.
In this mine network.
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Matt
What you do notice is the dwarves' bodies that are being dragged away: you can see footprints of those that are also pulling them aside.
You kind of figure out the idea of the pattern of the footsteps that are leading in that direction.
-speak Laura
Big, small?
-speak Matt
Most of them are also dwarven in shape.
-speak Laura
Oh, okay.
-speak Marisha
Most of them.
-speak Matt
So, there are, you can gather, dwarven feet dragging dwarven bodies deeper inside.
-speak Liam
Duergar.
-speak Laura
Dwarven centipede.
-speak Liam
It's the duergar.
-speak Matt
However, there are two bodies that are being dragged with no footprints whatsoever.
-speak Travis
What?
-speak Laura
Wings.
-speak Sam
They're being used like skateboards.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Marisha
Legolas style.
-speak Orion
Who and what are those?
-speak Liam
This is 2015.
-speak Travis
Is there any residue?
-speak Marisha
Yeah.
-speak Sam
Wow, if only we had asked some dwarves what's been going on down here.
-speak Laura
Is there any residue, blood?
-speak Orion
We already know.
-speak Laura
Green, red, black.
-speak Matt
From the dragging marks, there is no blood.
There's no signs of them dragging dead bodies off, at least.
-speak Laura
Does it look like they struggled?
-speak Matt
No, there's no struggle either.
-speak Travis
Oh crap, fire.
-speak Marisha
What about the walls?
How close are the walls?
-speak Matt
The walls here for this tunnel are about 15, 20 feet in width.
And about 10, 15 feet high.
-speak Marisha
Are there any scratch marks or anything like that on the walls?
-speak Matt
No.
-speak Liam
Let's stop dicking around and go into that mine.
TRAVIS,
-speak Taliesin
Yeah.
-speak Laura
Might as well.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Travis
We go further.
-speak Matt
You push further in.
-narrate
(Liam imitates sword being drawn)
-speak Matt
So, this tunnel, pitch black.
There's no light source aside from the one that you're creating.
You guys push forward.
And push forward, following the tracks.
And push forward.
And the tunnel winds and winds and descends.
And winds and descends.
About two hours--
(Laura, Marisha, Travis, and Sam)
What?!
-speak Matt
--of following this tunnel with little variation.
-speak Laura
Should've grabbed some dried fruit.
-speak Travis
We got a ton.
-speak Matt
Steadily declining and winding as it progresses.
Three hours go by.
This tunnel goes extremely deep.
Whatever managed to dig its way up here came from pretty far under this mine.
-speak Laura
At no point does it look like the bodies ever moved?
-speak Matt
Nope, no change in physicality.
No sign of struggle.
-speak Marisha
But there are the drag marks all the way?
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Liam
And two hours ago, I started stealthing and taking the lead.
When we're in the dark.
-speak Matt
All right, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
-speak Laura
I thought I was tracking.
-speak Liam
Uh, 29.
-speak Laura
Whoo, that's a good roll.
Yay, first good roll of the night.
-speak Matt
All right, there we go.
Your luck is changing now.
-speak Laura
Changing it around.
-speak Travis
Let me touch you.
-speak Matt
You feel pretty stealthy.
You guys look like, wait, where the hell did Vax go?
-speak Marisha
Oh shit, I hope he didn't hear me just say that about him.
Dammit.
-speak Laura
Oh thank you, brother.
-speak Taliesin
I'm having a serious Tom Sawyer island vibe.
-speak Laura
I found him.
-speak Liam
Looks fine.
-speak Matt
About four hours--
-speak Marisha
Are there any drafts?
Do I feel any wind flows or anything like that?
-speak Matt
No.
It is still.
It is stagnant air.
-narrate
(Laura coughs)
-speak Matt
Even more stagnant now.
Four hours of traveling deeper into this tunnel's path until--
-speak Laura
Anybody else have to go to the bathroom?
-speak Travis
He rolled, he rolled something.
-speak Laura
Oh no, he rolled.
-speak Marisha
And so, that is how I spent my 12th birthday.
-speak Sam
Great story, Keyleth.
And, yeah.
-speak Marisha
Let's see, what else.
-speak Travis
Hey Scanlan, you kill me, I kill you.
-speak Liam
There a great little cave alcove here, perfect for peeing in.
-speak Laura
Oh brother, good to see you.
-speak Liam
For everyone to pee.
-speak Laura
Am I over here, or am I over here?
Perhaps we could take a pee break here and proceed further into the mines.
-speak Marisha
I agree with that.
-speak Laura
That's a good idea.
-speak Liam
Do you catch my drift?
-speak Matt
As the four hour mark of travel into this tunnel presents itself, the tunnel finally widens and opens.
As the sound of distant water rushing reaches your ears.
-speak Laura
Oh no, I have to go to the bathroom.
-speak Matt
As Tiberius steps into this opening, the light cascades into this new cavern.
A large, beautiful open space presents itself, a good 100-foot-up ceiling.
From what you can see, a roaring river is now pouring out of the nearby rock, cascading over a cliffside into a waterfall down into this deeper, giant cavernous space.
-speak Laura
What about the tracks?
-speak Matt
The tracks continue in the direction of that river.
-speak Marisha
Into the river?
Like it goes into the water?
-speak Laura
Do we want to step into the room fully?
-speak Marisha
Why don't we send--
-speak Laura
I'm gonna stealth.
I'm gonna stealth, too.
-speak Marisha
Stealth twins.
-speak Orion
Do I detect any magic?
Stealth twins, 2015.
-speak Matt
You detect no magic.
You roll stealth.
-speak Laura

-speak Matt
Let's go ahead and take a bio break--
-speak Laura
Okay.
-speak Matt
--as the mystery begins to unveil.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Orion
I love a mystery.
-speak Matt
Be back here in about five, ten minutes, folks.
So keep an ear out.
-speak Travis
Quick, quick break.
-speak Orion
I'm gonna pee my face off.
-narrate
(Liam imitates rushing water)
-speak Matt
We'll be right back.
-speak Orion
Enjoy our butt shots, everybody.
-speak Matt
And everyone runs off to take care of their business.
Break
-speak Travis
Right, listen up.
If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw.
A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two--
(audio resets)
-speak Travis
Right, listen up.
If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw.
A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale.
-narrate
(record scratches)
-speak Travis
Wait.
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things.
Also ale.
In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting, elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing.

But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing.
His disobedience cost him dearly.
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die.
Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him.
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.
And they have remained close friends ever since.
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches.
Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors.
Also ale.
-speak Marisha
A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid.
You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet.
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions.
-narrate
(lightning roars)
-speak Marisha
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants.
Literally.
Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics.
It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts, which I do.
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations.
Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters.
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself.
Not knowing when, or if, she will ever return.
As she hikes down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader.
With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
-speak Taliesin
Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism.
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court.
During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell.
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.
He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible.
Then one night, Percy had a dream.
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family.
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

-speak Taliesin

-narrate
(gun firing)
-speak Sam
Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you.
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother.
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr.
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion.
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third.
On the battlefield, he'll support his allies but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome Pike.
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.

Greetings and salutations.
I am Tiberius Stormwind.
I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, from a politically respected family.
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic.
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history.
For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring.
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time.
In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world.
For months I would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend.
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye.
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever.
I found those answers to be unacceptable.
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.
Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia.
Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there.
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that.
-narrate
(stammers)
-speak Orion
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.
I just don't pay attention to things sometimes.
I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.
I can't help but show my true scales every now and then.
But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
-speak Liam
Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door.
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry.
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn.
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last.
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road.
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed back to the lands of their youth.
But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble.
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.
Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely.
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough--
-narrate
(sword slicing)
-speak Liam
--the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
-speak Laura
Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other.
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador.
He quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own.
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods.
She preferred the isolation.
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot.
And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.
Also, he is adorable and gives expert massages.

(group laughs)
-speak Sam
No, on the backside.
The winner is Yareth.
Congratulations.
Thank you for subscribing and paying attention and being in the chatroom and being awesome.

-narrate
(group cheers and claps)
-speak Sam
Well done, Yareth.
Thank you for coming.
-speak Marisha
Yareth.
-narrate
(group repeats Yalreth in funny voices)
-speak Matt
All right.
-narrate
(Marisha speaks gibberish)
-speak Liam
Enjoy your Player's Handbook 5E.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Matt
Hopefully more to come down the road.
We'll have more fun things for you guys.
So, anyway.
So, bringing it back to the game at hand.
As you've stepped into this large, cavernous space, you can hear the rush of water as the underground river begins to turn into a waterfall and drifts into a smaller body of water.
It's just out of sight beyond this cliff face.
Into this open, cavernous area.
-speak Laura
Oh, we just stealthed.
-speak Matt
You guys also stealthed, and what did you roll for stealth?
-speak Laura
I rolled 17.
-speak Matt
17, got it.
All right.
-speak Liam
Oh, less than that.
-speak Laura
You didn't.
-speak Liam
Oh, no I didn't, 18.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Laura
You were already stealthed, though.
-speak Liam
That's true.
-speak Matt
As you guys step into this space, there are sections of large rock, portions of stone that just jut out and block off portions from your view of this area.
Giant stalagmites and stalactites that just permeate the entirety of this cavern, which has been long, just building and building with elements drawn from the ceiling, from the waters that flow through.
You also faintly see a light source--
-speak Laura
-narrate
(whispers)
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Matt
--behind one of those rock pillars in the distance.
-speak Laura
-narrate
(whispers)
-speak Laura
Should we go check it out?
-speak Liam
Do we perceive anything in here with us before going that far in, yes?
-speak Matt
Make a perception check.
-speak Liam
18.
-speak Matt
18?
-speak Liam
Yes.
-speak Matt
You hear a very, very faint sound in the distance.
-narrate
(sharp noise)
-speak Sam
Jesus.
-narrate
(laughing)
-speak Orion
Did you hear that?
-speak Matt
That's not the sound.
Tiberius.
-speak Orion
I'm sorry.
-speak Laura
I have a passive perception of 21.
-speak Matt
Yes you do.
You hear a:
-narrate
(clicks tongue quickly)
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-speak Sam
A skittering.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(continues clicking)
-speak Liam
I might hear spiders.
-speak Marisha
Oh.
-speak Laura
Ugh.
-speak Travis
Or crab.
-speak Liam
Or something.
-speak Marisha
Making it old school.
-speak Sam
Maybe it's a very faint maraca dance of some sort.
-speak Laura
What direction is it coming from?
-speak Travis
That would be better.
-speak Matt
It's hard to tell at this point, it seems to be just kind of loosely atmospheric.
-speak Travis
Is the light coming from over the water?
-speak Matt
The very, very faint light you see, no.
It's adjacent to the water to the right of you.
-speak Travis
Okay.
-speak Liam
I think we're dealing with spiders.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(continues clicking)
-speak Laura
I think you guys should hang back, and we should stealth over and see how many it looks like we're dealing with.
-speak Liam
The twins will creep forward.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You both creep forward.
-speak Laura
Trinket stays with the group.
Trinket, stay with Grog.
-speak Orion
I'm gonna dispel my light spell.
-speak Matt
Pitch darkness falls upon all of you.
-speak Travis
What did you do that for?
-speak Sam
Because now they don't know where we are.
-speak Laura
But we can't see anything.
-speak Travis
They're spiders.
-speak Marisha
While he does that, I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a cave bear.
-speak Orion
Can you not see now?
-speak Laura
We can see in dim light.
-speak Marisha
Cave bears have darkvision.
-speak Marisha
I'm pretty sure.
-speak Liam
No, dim light only.
-speak Matt
Do they?
-speak Laura
What'd you turn into?
-speak Orion
It doesn't matter, do you want me to turn it back on?
-speak Taliesin
A cave bear.
-speak Marisha
Yeah, subterranean bears, they have darkvision.
-speak Matt
All right.
So.
-speak Sam
He can just make light again.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and roll a perception check.
-speak Liam
Turn it back on.
-speak Marisha
No, leave it off!
-speak Orion
I dispel it again, I'm sorry.
-speak Marisha
Fuck!
Fuck!
-speak Matt
Light, light light, light light.
-speak Taliesin
How did you do that?
-speak Marisha
It's been a bad night.
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Marisha
12 total.
-speak Liam
Clap on
-narrate
(claps)
-speak Liam
, clap off.
-narrate
(claps)
-speak Matt
As you glance about in cave bear form, you look up and all you can make out is shifting movement across the ceiling.
-narrate
(group groans at once)
-speak Matt
But it's large.
It's not a small creature.
You glance off to your left and you look up and you see a second one.
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Travis
Oh fuck.
-speak Matt
And both dislodge.
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-speak Matt
All of you hear two loud, cacophonous, thunderous slam sounds--
-narrate
(imitates loud thudding)
-speak Laura
Definitely hit light now.
-speak Matt
--on the ground next to you--
-narrate
(screeching noise)
-speak Liam
I quickly whisper to my sister, to the boundaries.
-speak Marisha
And I just go:
-narrate
(roaring noise)
-speak Orion
Light!
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Liam
Vex and Vax dance backwards against the walls.
-speak Matt
There is a surprise round.
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Travis
Oh God.
-speak Liam
But I heard them.
-speak Marisha
I know.
-narrate
(roars)
-speak Laura
Transform back.
-speak Matt
All right.
So you guys are stealthed off to the side there.
-speak Liam
That's beautiful.
-speak Laura
I'm on the other side.
-speak Liam
Look at that fun map.
-speak Matt
There's Trinket.
-speak Liam
Thank you, Matt, for doing all the work on these maps and shit.
-speak Matt
That's what I do.
So there's the water there, rushing off into the waterfall that goes further down.
-speak Laura
Can I stealth against the other wall?
-speak Travis
Waterfall is where on that map?
-speak Matt
The waterfall is right here.
-speak Travis
Got it.
-speak Matt
So the river kind of pours over, falls into the water below.
There are some of these large rock elements here.
-speak Sam
What are they?
-speak Matt
You cannot tell what's beyond this area, which is where the light source is coming from.
-narrate
(imitates thudding)
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Laura

-narrate
(imitates thudding)
-speak Travis
Those look like umber hulks.
-speak Matt
They are.
-narrate
(group screams)
-speak Matt
You've had one brief run-in with a single umber hulk in the past.
-speak Laura
Now we have two.
As two slam into the ground beside you, dropping from the ceiling portion.
-speak Laura
Fudge!
-speak Travis
I have their claws still.
-speak Laura
Wait, do you guys remember--
-narrate
(Matt growls and snarls)
-speak Laura
Do they respond to vibration?
-speak Orion
I cast stoneskin on myself immediately.
You don't have that much time, unfortunately.
Because they are upon you, it a surprise round.
-speak Travis
Shit!
-speak Laura
Do they respond to vibration?
I forget.
-speak Travis
They responded to something.
-speak Matt
They respond to the something.
-speak Laura
Can we remember with investigation or insight?
-speak Liam
Limericks, limericks, they respond to limericks.
-speak Matt
So this one shifts up over there, and this one moves up to there.
Gleans past you, as it does not notice you.
-speak Laura
Yeah, but it's still big.
-speak Matt
This one comes towards you, Percy.
-speak Taliesin
Damn it.
-speak Matt
Attacking you with each of its claws and its mandibles.
The first strike comes at you with a 13 to hit with its first claw.
What's your AC?
-speak Taliesin
Ah, 17.
-speak Matt
You, woomf, just manage to dodge out of the way as these giant-bladed claws sweep next to your face.
The second strike comes to you at a 21.
-speak Travis
Oh shit.
That hits.
-speak Taliesin
That hits.
I'm going to use a gunslinger's dodge.
-speak Laura
Gunslinger's dodge.
-speak Taliesin
Wait, let's see if I can do this.
It's not enough, nevermind, so no.
I just gotta take it.
-speak Matt
All right, so the claw finds purchase across your torso.
-narrate
(imitates claw slicing)
-speak Matt
The armor catches most of it.
However, the slash does leave an impact on you, as you can feel the taste of iron in the back of your throat.
You suffer nine points of slashing damage.
-speak Taliesin
Oh, okay.
-speak Matt
And just as you pull back the mandibles, time to crunch down upon you.
And that is going to be a 27 to hit.
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-speak Travis
Do their eyes do something?
-speak Matt
You take 14 points of slashing damage, as the mandibles slice down, clamping onto your shoulder.
You manage to pull free, but in doing so, you wrench the pointed portions of the mandible across your shoulder, pulling open the flesh in this horrible jagged pattern.
-speak Taliesin
Ow.
-speak Matt
That brings us to the other one, who is attacking Grog.
-speak Marisha
Grog!
You're right there in front of it.
The biggest and most viable visual it can find.
-speak Sam
♫ No motherfucker, miss ♫ I start singing using my Cutting Words reaction.
To try to distract him.
-speak Matt
All right, so go ahead and roll your d8 to reduce his attack roll.
-speak Travis
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Travis
No motherfucker, miss.
-speak Sam
d8?
-speak Matt
d8.
-speak Sam
Three.
-speak Matt
All right.
That would have been a 20 to hit.
That brings it to a 17.
-speak Travis
18.
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Sam
I saved your life!
-speak Matt
So, as you begin singing out, as it pulls back with--
-speak Sam
♫ No motherfucker ♫
-speak Matt
--its mandibles to strike at Grog, it
-narrate
(clicks)
-speak Matt
looks off to you for a second, goes back, at which point Grog has put his axe up to its face and is holding it at bay.
As its mandibles are tied in with its blades, and the handle of the axe is trying to hold it back.
It strikes at you with its two claws, Grog.
That is going to be a 27.
-speak Travis
That hits.
-speak Matt
And a 14.
-speak Travis
Misses.
-speak Matt
Okay, then from the one claw that gets you, you take six points of slashing damage.
-speak Travis
Okay.
-speak Matt
All right everyone, roll initiative.
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Laura
I'm so scared to roll.
-speak Marisha
I know, it's been so bad.
-speak Sam
Best one of I've had.
-speak Taliesin
Ah, not horrible.
-speak Laura
Oh, good.
-speak Travis
Ball sack.
-speak Marisha
Uh, it's okay.
-speak Matt
All right, so, 25 to 20?
-speak Laura
24.
-speak Matt
24.
-speak Travis
There you go.
A little redemption.
-speak Laura
That's right.
-speak Matt
Nice, we got some Vex up top.
20 to 15 anyone?
-speak Taliesin
17.
-speak Marisha
17 as well.
-speak Sam
19.
-speak Travis
Ah, yeah.
-speak Liam
15, 15.
-speak Matt
All right, got some Scanlan up there.
17, 17.
-speak Laura
-narrate
(whispers)
-speak Laura
They're both surrounding me even with my awesome things.
-speak Matt
Percy, Keyleth.
-speak Matt
So 15 to--
-speak Liam
15.
-speak Matt
15.
-speak Orion
13.
-speak Travis
I'm 14.
Tiberius and I are 13-14.
-speak Laura
Ugh, come on Grog!
-speak Matt
Wait, uh, 14?
-speak Orion
13.
-speak Matt
14.
Grog and Tiberius.
-speak Travis
It's the ghost pepper cookies.
-speak Matt
All right, cool.
Top of the round.
Vex.
-speak Laura
Hyah!
I am going to shoot the one.
-speak Matt
Before you do that--
-speak Sam
Oh, shit!
-speak Matt
As you're going to reach back, you look over into its strange, glistening, black, dead, insect-like eyes of the umber hulk, and you feel this strange wave of mental confusion hit your head.
Go ahead and make a--
-speak Travis
I knew it.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make a saving throw.
This is going to be charisma saving throw.
-speak Marisha
Is this what confused you and had you running out the door?
-speak Travis
I fell out a fucking 120 foot hole.
-speak Matt
So you roll d20, add your charisma saving throw at the top of your character.
-speak Laura
Okay, so I gotta do my math.
That's 11, but I get a plus two from my ring that I'm wearing for saving throws, so.
-speak Matt
Okay, so it's 13.
-speak Laura
13.
-speak Matt
All right.
The wave of confusion takes hold over your brain.
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Matt
We're gonna go ahead and find out what happens.
-narrate
(Laura groans)
-speak Travis
Maybe he'll ask you to make some cookies.
-speak Matt
All right--
-speak Laura
You're gonna have me do nothing wrong?
-speak Matt
You reach for it, and you space out for a second.
Your hands fall to your side.
And you stand there.
-speak Travis
Aw, fuck.
-speak Matt
Trinket is looking for some sort of cue from you of what to do.
-speak Laura
Does he look confused too?
-speak Matt
No, but Trinket's looking to you for some sort of direction and is getting none.
This is a very clustered space, too.
Can barely see you over this.
-speak Matt
That brings us to Scanlan.
-speak Laura
But I was stealthed, though.
-speak Sam
Don't worry, I'll help you my dear.
-speak Matt
I know.
Doesn't matter if you're stealthed.
He couldn't see you, but you could see him.
-speak Sam
I'm gonna take a step back behind Trinket.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-narrate
(Travis Laughs)
-speak Laura
Good call.
-speak Sam
Actually, wait.
How far am I from my furthest--
-speak Matt
Are you averting your gaze from the guys, or are you looking at 'em directly?
-speak Sam
No, averting my gaze.
But how far am I from my--
-speak Laura
Nobody look at them.
-speak Sam
--my furthest fellow?
Oh, I'm 60 feet, okay.
And I sing my counter-charm song.
♫ Magic magic, go away, come again another day ♫ So all of us have advantage on saving throws for the charming spells.
If they are charming us.
I don't know if they are.
-speak Matt
This is confusion.
-speak Sam
No, what?
-speak Matt
I don't think--
-speak Sam
Frightened or charmed, it's not the same thing?
-speak Matt
Mm.
This is technically a confusion effect.
So yeah.
-speak Sam
Okay.
-speak Laura
Oh, wait.
Oh, no.
-speak Sam
Okay.
-speak Matt
So as you finish your song, you're like--
-speak Sam
It did not work.
-speak Matt
Doesn't seem to be having an effect unfortunately.
-speak Sam
Okay.
And then as my bonus action, who got hit first?
You did?
I'll just throw a healing word to him.
-speak Matt
Okay.
Just go ahead and roll, feeling him.
That's a d4 plus five.
Yeah, you got it.
Percy.
-speak Taliesin
Mm.
-speak Matt
You heal--
-speak Sam
What is this?
-speak Matt
It's a four.
-speak Sam
Oh, that's a four.
Okay.
-speak Matt
So you heal nine hit points, and it's your turn.
What do you got, Percy?
-speak Taliesin
Up to 58, let me just fix that, there we go.
Okay, where am I on the board?
-speak Matt
You are right here in front--
-speak Taliesin
Okay, so there's no getting away.
I'm gonna-- I can basically without-- I remember I'm not supposed to look at these things.
I know where this thing is.
I can pull my gun and just take a shot, right?
-speak Matt
So averting your gaze, you take a shot.
You are at disadvantage on the attack roll.
-speak Taliesin
How much?
-speak Matt
Just disadvantage.
-speak Taliesin
I'm just disadvantage?
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Taliesin
Well okay, that's fine.
I'm gonna spend a grit point for a deadshot, so I'm gonna get a plus one to hit.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Travis
Come on, Perce.
-speak Taliesin
Aha!
That will be a-- with the plus one, that's a 28, 29, 30 to hit.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Travis
Get after it, nasty!
-speak Matt
Roll again, as you have disadvantage.
Because you're not looking at it directly.
-speak Laura
Ugh, please be good.
-speak Taliesin
That's still 25 to hit.
-speak Matt
That hits.
-speak Taliesin
26, actually.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Taliesin
And then I get extra damage because I did deadshot.
So that's plus one, so that will be a-- it's a 2d8 plus five plus ice, because I'm hitting with my ice shot.
And that's seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
14 points of ice damage.
-speak Matt
14 points of ice damage.
Nice.
-speak Taliesin
And then I have a second shot and I'm just gonna take one more shot at him really quick.
-speak Matt
Okay, also at disadvantage.
-speak Taliesin
I fail.
In fact, my gun jams.
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Matt
Okay.
So as you go to fire, it's like you--
-narrate
(imitates gun firing)
-speak Matt
fire the first shot averting the gaze.
-speak Laura
We're all gonna die.
You spin the barrel, go back to go ahead and fire again, as you do
-narrate
(imitates gun clicking)
-speak Laura
You pull the trigger for a second, and you feel a slight
-narrate
(imitates fizzled explosion)
-speak Laura
inside the barrel.
-speak Travis
Damn it!
-speak Marisha
Oh, no.
-speak Matt
And you feel the actual metal get extremely cold, and you have you have to shake it out like, aw, damn it.
-speak Taliesin
Since I can't move, I'm gonna-- my movement, my minor is gonna be just fixing my-- yeah, so.
-speak Matt
Okay, so your action is just trying to fix the gun?
-speak Taliesin
Yeah.
-speak Matt
All right.
That brings us to--
-speak Taliesin
Damn.
-speak Matt
Keyleth.
-speak Laura
Keyleth, don't look at them.
-speak Marisha
Okay.
-speak Matt
Just as a note, your inspiration dice that you give can be used on saving throws as well.
-speak Sam
Okay.
But I haven't given any.
-speak Matt
No.
-speak Marisha
Um, I'm a bear right now.
-speak Matt
You are a bear, which I will, for the sake of this, give you the kitty.
-speak Marisha
Bring out Minxie.
-speak Travis
Minxie.
-speak Matt
Minxie is the form, but you are a bear.
-speak Marisha
Okay, first and foremost, I'm gonna go ahead-- and I don't know if this is gonna help.
But I'm gonna throw up a fog cloud.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Marisha
Maybe.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Marisha
No?
-speak Matt
So fog cloud.
The entire space, it's a 20 foot radius?
I believe, if I recall from the one he did yesterday.
-speak Marisha
But it screws our vision, though, doesn't it?
-speak Laura
Well, yeah.
-speak Matt
Everybody gets obscured vision.
-speak Marisha
But I mean, we wouldn't be able to see them.
Would it help with the confusion is what I'm hoping.
-speak Laura
That could help, that could help.
-speak Sam
Do your thing.
Do what you do.
-speak Marisha
Or would it be bad?
-speak Laura
Try it.
Do it, Keyleth, go with your instincts.
-speak Taliesin
Don't think about what's the worst that could possibly happen.
-speak Marisha
I'm bursting out a fog cloud, and then--
-speak Matt
Well to cast, you have to get out of creature form, remember?
-speak Marisha
Oh, that's right.
I didn't throw a bow.
-speak Matt
So you're a bear.
-speak Marisha
I'm a bear.
Nevermind, I'm just gonna do a full round of attacks.
-speak Liam
It's go time, go time!
-narrate
(claps)
-speak Marisha
That one right there.
-speak Laura
Keep your eyes closed.
-speak Matt
All right, so you move up to there.
Go ahead and do your full round of attacks.
-speak Matt
I am doing multi-attack.
-speak Matt
Okay, are you averting your gaze or not?
-speak Marisha
I'm a cave bear, I'm blind.
I'm like a blind fish.
I have darkvision and, like, cataracts.
-speak Matt
Darkvision means you can see in the dark.
-speak Matt
But it doesn't mean that you don't see.
-narrate
(Sam laughs)
-speak Marisha
Well I'm a bear.
-speak Matt
You are a bear.
I'm eating at his leg.
I'm not looking at his eyes.
I'm not, like, waxing poetically at how sexy he is.
-speak Matt
No.
-speak Marisha
Not whispering sweet nothings in his ear.
-speak Matt
I know.
-speak Marisha
I'm gnawing at his leg.
-speak Matt
That's true.
-speak Liam
Go for the kill!
-speak Matt
Make a charisma saving throw.
-speak Marisha
Make a charisma saving throw?
-speak Matt
Yes.
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Laura
Next time just avert your gaze.
(Taliesin And Marisha)
Oh!
-speak Marisha
That's good.
16.
-speak Matt
16?
You can feel the oppression of the umber hulk's gaze, but you shrug it off, your bear mind not affected by the measly tricks and traits--
-speak Marisha
Urgh, I'm a bear!
-speak Matt
-of these strange underground entities.
-speak Marisha
Okay.
Now I'm attacking.
-speak Matt
Roll for your four attacks.
-speak Marisha
First one probably misses.
With my claw, 14.
-speak Matt
14 misses.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Orion
She got a pizza.
-speak Marisha
With the claw attacks, do I have two claw attacks, do I roll for both?
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Marisha
Okay, so the first one is 19,
-speak Matt
Hits.
-speak Marisha
Second one, second claw attack is 18.
-speak Matt
Also hits.
-speak Marisha
Okay.
So I am doing 2d6 plus five twice.
So six plus--
-speak Taliesin
It's 11.
-speak Marisha
Five, so 11.
-speak Taliesin
Ooh.
-speak Marisha
Plus 17-- 20 damage.
-speak Matt
20 damage.
Nice.
-speak Taliesin
25.
-speak Marisha
Oh, 25.
Sorry, 25.
-speak Matt
All righty.
-speak Taliesin
Yes.
-speak Marisha
25 damage.
-speak Matt
So, as you shake off the effect, you reach for it, lashing out, two large strikes.
The second one gets a distinct carve into the back of the umber hulk's hide.
You can see a portion of its chitinous back armor gets kind of pulled off in a chunk.
And it
-narrate
(snarls)
-speak Matt
, reels back from the impact and readies itself for a second round of attacks.
-speak Marisha
Me and Trinket.
-speak Matt
There you go.
-speak Marisha
Going at this.
-narrate
(Matt laughs)
-speak Marisha
Bear style.
-speak Matt
They go.
This one turns towards and moves this way to focus on the cave bear that just thrashed against its hide.
While this one turns and moves in towards Grog.
But now turns and sees the-- actually no.
It stays there, fixed to Grog.
So making its multi-strike against you, Keyleth.
That is a 26 to hit.
-speak Marisha
Hits.
-speak Matt
That's mandibles.
17 to hit with its claw.
-speak Marisha
Hits.
-speak Matt
And 18 to hit with its claw.
-speak Marisha
Hits.
-speak Matt
All right, so you take six points of slashing damage from the first claw.
Eight points of slashing damage from the second claw.
And then the mandibles deal fifteen points of slashing damage, as the umber hulk just turns to you, and as a reaction to your assault--
-speak Marisha
What was the last one?
-speak Matt
The last one was 15.
Just unleashes an array of strikes against you.
-narrate
(Matt growls)
-speak Liam
Hit it in the face.
-speak Matt
That brings us to the other one who's attacking you, Grog.
-speak Marisha
Back at him, yeah.
-speak Matt
That is a 12 to hit.
Pretty sure misses.
-speak Travis
Misses.
-speak Matt
Another 12 to hit, 'cause it likes to roll fours, apparently.
-speak Travis
Give me another four.
-speak Matt
For the mandibles, it's a 20.
-speak Travis
20 hits.
-speak Matt
You're taking damage, fool.
That is 18 points of slashing damage against you.
-speak Travis
I have a half damage to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage?
-speak Matt
You haven't raged yet.
-speak Travis
So I'm not raging?
!
-speak Matt
You haven't raged yet!
It isn't your turn yet.
-speak Travis
But I'm so angry.
-speak Matt
I know.
You're about to be so angry.
-speak Travis
18 points.
-speak Matt
You're gonna be so angry.
18 points of slashing damage.
The mandibles crush down on your body, and you can feel them pierce into your chest.
Your exposed musculature is then torn in a jagged form as you feel the blood begin to pour down the front of your torso.
-speak Travis
It's all right, it's okay.
-speak Laura
That's brutal.
-speak Travis
My turn's coming.
-speak Matt
That ends their turn.
Vax.
-speak Liam
So I can see what's up.
I saw what it did to my sister, so I'm gonna jump on its back.
I'm gonna swivel my daggers around and just stab it in the face.
-speak Laura
But keep your gaze averted.
-speak Liam
Yeah, I'm seeing the back of his fucking spine or head.
I'm gonna stab him in the face twice.
-speak Matt
Go for it.
-speak Liam
Okay.
-speak Liam
Nine-- 20.
-speak Matt
That hits.
-speak Liam
Okay.
So then I'll do damage.
The other one's an 18.
I rolled in advance.
-speak Laura
That counts, that counts!
-speak Matt
That one, that's the one!
-speak Liam
So, 10, plus sneak attack damage, right?
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Liam
Yeah, okay.
-speak Matt
He doesn't know you were there, you were stealthed.
-speak Liam
Okay.
One.
Four.
Eight.
Nine.
13, 26, 36 damage from the first dagger.
-speak Marisha
Whoo!
-speak Liam
Face, in his face, and the next was an 18.
-speak Matt
Not in his face.
Not in his face.
-speak Liam
Not in his face?
-speak Matt
It's back.
-speak Liam
But I wanted I wanted to do this to his head.
Okay, whatever works.
-speak Travis
The reach around?
-speak Orion
The old reach around stabbing.
-speak Liam
The reach around, the reach around.
That what I was going for.
And then, where's my four, 1d4.
One's a three, but no, just three.
-speak Matt
Three, okay.
-speak Liam
With my flametongue dagger which I don't know if he likes or dislikes, but that's what I've done.
-speak Matt
Okay, so, as you leap on its back, grab purchase on one of its chitinous plates, bring your first dagger forward and jam it into the side of its head, as it pulls back, you hear a
-narrate
(snarling)
-speak Matt
as it reacts to the immediate pain and begins to reach one of its claws to try and knock you off.
As you do, you put the blade back into your belt, grab with your other hand, pull your other dagger, and slam it into the other side of its head.
-speak Travis
Yeah!
-speak Matt
This time it shrugs you off, and you manage to just land on your feet barely, behind it, still faced away from you.
That brings us to Grog.
-narrate
(Travis grunts)
-speak Matt
Rage.
-speak Marisha
Rage!
-speak Travis
Now I'm angry.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Travis
I would like to rage, and not only rage, I would like to go into a frenzied rage.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Travis
For three full attacks.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Travis
While I'm raging so hard, that I pop all the capillaries in my eyeballs, so I can't really see that well.
And I just swing a lot.
-speak Matt
All right, I'm gonna check one thing real fast.
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-speak Travis
Oh, shit!
Don't check, look, I'm rolling.
-narrate
(Marisha and Laura laugh)
-speak Travis
30.
-speak Liam
There once was a bard from Nantucket.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Liam
Who got his flute caught--
-speak Travis
I gain one level of exhaustion with a rage hit.
-speak Liam
--in a bucket.
-speak Matt
I will say, situationally, because of the fact that your rage that you have advantage on the saving throw against the confusion effect.
(Marisha and Laura)
Oh.
Your mind is so filled with aggression.
-speak Travis
I got that big, like, nasty thing.
-speak Matt
So make charisma saving throw.
-speak Taliesin
Oh, what a good idea.
-speak Travis
Is that a 20?
-speak Matt
Yep.
-speak Laura
Plus one.
-speak Travis
11.
-speak Matt
Roll again, you have advantage.
-speak Liam
Better, better, better, no.
-speak Travis
Five.
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-speak Matt
Let's see what happens.
-speak Laura
No!
-speak Orion
Roll a two.
-speak Matt
So--
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Laura
Now he's raging, too.
-speak Matt
--as you rage--
-speak Marisha
No, dammit.
-speak Matt
--you feel the influence of the umber hulk's gaze pierce your eyes and the fury fills you, and you reach out and slash with your axe.
However, it does not reach for the umber hulk.
Go ahead and roll an attack, Grog.
-speak Laura
Oh no, who's he hitting?
-speak Travis
A one!
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Sam
Finally!
-speak Marisha
Yes!
-speak Matt
There's a loud clanging sound, as a giant, angry, swooping bladed greataxe misses Tiberius's head by inches.
-speak Orion
Oh!
Grog, what are you doing?
-speak Matt
Before slamming into the stone right up against the side of the wall.
You can just see now this kind of loose, crazed look in his eye.
-narrate
(growls maniacally)
-speak Matt
Foam begins to gather at the side of his mouth.
-speak Orion
Oh, now you're all screwed up.
-speak Liam
We have a problem.
-speak Laura
Yeah, this could be bad.
-speak Liam
We have an angry Grog.
-speak Matt
Tiberius, you're up.
-speak Orion
Damn it, Grog.
-speak Travis
It's my turn?
-speak Matt
No, that's your turn.
-speak Travis
Oh, that's my turn.
-speak Marisha
Tiberius, help.
-speak Laura
At least your rolled a one.
-speak Travis
I did.
I didn't hurt anybody yet.
-speak Orion
I look at Grog, and I'm like, will you stop it!
I cast Dispel Magic on him.
-narrate
(Travis snarls)
-speak Matt
Cast Dispel Magic?
-speak Orion
Yeah.
-speak Laura
On Grog?
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Sam
I don't think it's magic.
-speak Orion
Yeah, he's being controlled by it.
-speak Travis
He can do whatever.
-speak Liam
It's more natural, it's creature-based.
-speak Travis
She's also being controlled.
-speak Orion
I know, but you're a big, hulking, crazy mofo.
-speak Matt
No, it is a magical force.
-speak Orion
Yes, it is.
-speak Matt
Forced to make a save.
-speak Travis
Save me, save me.
-speak Matt
Go head and make an arcana check.
-narrate
(Sam and Laura sing along with tense background music)
-speak Orion
Uh, 17.
-speak Matt
17.
The chaotic influence in your brain begins to dissipate, and the rage-filled gaze begins to fill your eyes once again, this time clarifying on the umber hulk in front of you.
-speak Laura
Thanks a lot, Tiberius.
-speak Sam
Thank god.
-speak Orion
I'm not done yet.
I slap him.
Just get on this, will you?
-narrate
(Travis snarls)
-speak Orion
I use two SP points to do quickening spell.
I cast Grand Column under myself.
-narrate
(imitates rock moving)
-speak Orion
Fifteen feet up in the air.
-speak Marisha
Nice.
-narrate
(Orion spits)
-speak Matt
So, the stone beneath Tiberius's feet rises up, creating a column fifteen feet above the rest.
He is now raised on a platform.
I'll put him right there.
Looking down upon the battlefield.
-speak Orion
-narrate
(clears throat)
-speak Orion
that is my turn.
-speak Matt
All right, Vex, you're up.
-speak Laura
Oh, do I have to cast a saving throw or am I fine?
-speak Liam
Be a badass, be a badass.
-speak Matt
Are you looking at it, or are you averting your gaze?
-speak Laura
No, I'm averting my gaze even though I'm confused apparently.
-speak Matt
Well, the confusion only lasts one turn.
-speak Laura
Okay, good.
I am not.
What's that thingy behind me?
-speak Marisha
Oh, we've got these.
-speak Matt
This here?
-speak Laura
No.
-speak Matt
This here?
-speak Laura
Yeah, what's that?
-speak Matt
This is rock.
-speak Laura
How high is it?
-speak Matt
This is about 25, 30 feet up.
-speak Travis
Use your laser pointer, dude.
-speak Matt
And this is where the light source is coming from.
You can't look over that way.
-speak Laura
All, right cool.
I avert my gaze but I listen very carefully to the sound of where it's coming from.
-narrate
(Taliesin whistles)
-speak Laura
And I shoot in that direction.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-narrate
(Taliesin and Marisha imitate birds)
-speak Matt
So go ahead and make your attacks against this fellow.
-speak Travis
That's some Hawkeye stuff.
-speak Matt
You shooting this one?
-speak Laura
Let's do the one that is surrounded so I get like, what, flanking bonus or something.
-speak Matt
For ranged, you would not get a bonus for that unfortunately.
-speak Laura
Lame.
All right.
-speak Matt
So are you shooting at the one behind you?
This one?
-speak Laura
Sure.
Okay.
-speak Laura
No, no, no, no, the other one.
-speak Matt
Okay, all right.
So, make your attacks with a disadvantage, as you're kind of keeping your eyes back and shooting in its general direction.
-speak Marisha
Big money, no whammies.
-speak Laura
12, both of them were 12.
But plus 11.
-speak Matt
Plus, eleven?
Hits.
-speak Laura
Yes!
Oh, and I get two attacks, right?
-speak Matt
You do, yes.
-speak Laura
Okay.
Still disadvantage?
-speak Matt
Yep.
-speak Laura
15 plus 11, hits.
-speak Matt
That also hits, yeah.
So both attacks hit.
-speak Laura
Yes!
-speak Matt
Did you want to use your bonus action for anything?
-speak Laura
Oh yes, Hunter's Mark.
-speak Matt
All right, so you throw Hunter's Mark on this umber hulk there.
-speak Laura
Yes, I do.
-speak Matt
But you're like, you're my quarry, ugh.
Keeping your eyes back.
You go ahead and pull your first and second arrow,
-narrate
(imitates bow firing arrows)
-speak Matt
, letting them loose, kind of letting a little bit of faith take your arrows to the wind.
Both finding purchase on your foe.
-speak Laura
Can I use bloodseeking bow on that one?
-speak Matt
You can, yes.
-speak Laura
Sweet.
All right, cool.
So that's 15, no, 11.
And then 15.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Laura
It was good so I kept it.
-speak Travis
She dropped it, but it was a good roll.
-speak Orion
Yeah, take the drop.
-speak Laura
Plus bloodseeking, which is 10 damage, plus Hunter's Mark, which is a six, which is three.
-speak Matt
So total damage of.
.
.
?
-speak Laura
Oh, I have to add.
-narrate
(Matt laughs)
-speak Laura
15 plus 11 plus three.
-speak Matt
26, 29 damage.
-speak Marisha
Woo!
-speak Matt
Nice!
-narrate
(Liam imitates arrows firing)
-speak Matt
So, as your arrows sink into him, one blasts into him.
Fire cascades up the side, you can see the middle of its plates beginning to burn and torch the cinderous glow.
It reels back, gets its claws ready, now fixated on you 'cause you just announced your presence to it.
-speak Laura
I'm looking again, so.
-speak Matt
All right.
Anything you wanna do with.
.
.
?
-speak Laura
Trinket?
-speak Matt
Trinket.
-speak Laura
Oh, yeah.
Can he run up and attack the other one?
While keeping his eyes down?
-speak Matt
He would have to use one of your attacks to do that.
-speak Laura
Oh okay, well then he's just hanging out.
-speak Matt
Trinket's just hanging out.
-speak Laura
He's protecting Scanlan.
-narrate
(Matt imitates bear growling)
-speak Laura
Yeah, big old bear protecting your gnome.
-speak Laura
Protect the gnome!
-speak Liam
Gnome coverage.
(Marisha And Taliesin)
Gnome coverage.
-speak Matt
No healer this week.
What could possibly go wrong?
-speak Marisha
Gnomewatch 2015.
-speak Matt
Scanlan, you're up.
-speak Sam
Scanlan.
-speak Liam
Ride the bear, Scanlan.
-speak Sam
Ride the bear.
-speak Travis
Oh my God.
-speak Sam
I will just step forward a little, and I will cast polymorph on our big friend that we're surrounding.
And I'll turn him into a snail.
-speak Marisha
A snail?
Aww!
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Travis
Can you do that?
!
-speak Sam
Yes.
-speak Matt
What's the DC, the difficulty class on your spells?
-speak Sam
Through the horn of clarity or whatever.
So it's 17.
-speak Matt
17, alright.
-speak Sam
Or no, 19, sorry, 19.
-speak Matt
19.
-speak Sam
It's plus two.
-speak Matt
So, as the two umber hulks are there, the one that's in the center of the group,
-narrate
(snarls)
-speak Matt
.
-speak Laura
Oh, Tiberius.
-speak Laura
Rears back, beginning to unleash its series of attacks, and then
-narrate
(sharp hiss)
-speak Laura
, into this tiny--
-speak Travis
What?
!
-speak Matt
--snail form on the ground.
-speak Laura
Awesome!
-speak Liam
Don't touch the snail until the--
-speak Laura
Why?
-speak Liam
'Cause he'll poof out into the fucking big guy again.
-speak Sam
Don't hurt the snail.
-speak Liam
Leave it, leave it.
-speak Sam
Don't pick up the snail.
Just be nice to the snail.
-speak Liam
Leave it alone.
Hit the other one.
-speak Orion
Don't do anything.
I'll take care of the snail.
-narrate
(talking over each other)
-speak Matt
There's a tiny, tiny little snail on the ground now that looks very confused.
-speak Laura
That's confusing.
-speak Matt
Very confused, which is ironic for an umber hulk, to feel confused.
-speak Sam
As a bonus action, I give dice to-- who's coming up next?
Who's coming up soon?
-speak Matt
Next'll be Percy.
-speak Sam
Percy, you get dice.
-speak Taliesin
What dice do I get?
-speak Matt
d8.
-speak Sam
A d8 for inspiration.
-speak Taliesin
A d8?
All right.
Excellent.
-speak Matt
Percy, you're up.
-narrate
(Sam imitates flutes)
-speak Matt
Gotta do my app.
-speak Matt
Do your app, fuck it up.
-speak Orion
Do the app.
-speak Sam
No, it's not ready.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Taliesin
I'm gonna take one of my two actions to clear my gun.
-speak Travis
Yeah, the jam.
-speak Taliesin
Clear the jam.
And then set up for a fire shot.
And I'm gonna take a fire shot.
Am I at a disadvantage?
-narrate
(tinny electronic music)
-speak Matt
You're inspired.
-speak Sam
It's so weak, it's so weak.
-speak Travis
You've gotta get it better.
-speak Matt
So, who are you shooting?
-speak Taliesin
I'm shooting our friend over there.
I've just sort of turned, and I'm firing.
-speak Taliesin
So am I at a disadvantage?
-speak Matt
Averting your gaze?
-speak Taliesin
I'm averting my gaze, but I know where it is.
-speak Matt
Right.
So go ahead and fire at disadvantage.
-speak Sam
You got the dice, you got the dice.
-speak Taliesin
Okay.
14 with the disadvantage.
-speak Matt
14 with the disadvantage will miss, unfortunately.
-narrate
(imitates gun firing)
-speak Matt
The fire shot arcs off into the distance--
-speak Taliesin
Oh oh, actually--
-speak Marisha
Oh yeah, inspiration.
-speak Matt
Add the inspiration dice.
-speak Taliesin
17.
-speak Matt
17 will just barely hit.
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Taliesin
Well done, well done, ha ha!
-speak Orion
Good shot!
-speak Liam
Good stunt work, Tiberius.
-speak Taliesin
So, that's gonna do-- ba-bumpa-bum.
-speak Orion
I have to wait to figure out when to open which one.
-speak Taliesin
That's 17 fire damage, 17 fire damage.
-speak Matt
17 fire damage, nice.
Okay, you hear the shot hit, and you hear a cracking sound as one of its plates actually freezes and shatters off of its body, exposing kind of a fleshy undercarriage.
-speak Marisha
Nice.
(Orion And Marisha)
Undercarriage.
-speak Matt
This umber hulk is starting to look a little rough.
That brings us to the top of-- Do you want to move or stay where you are?
-speak Taliesin
I'm going to step back to-- bring me back two to three steps, just like, back away.
-speak Matt
Back here.
-speak Taliesin
Yeah.
Just like, here.
-speak Laura
Avoid the snail.
-speak Sam
Yeah, don't step on the snail.
-speak Taliesin
I'm not stepping on the snail.
-speak Taliesin
Yeah, that's good.
-speak Matt
There?
Okay, good.
All right, that brings us to--
-speak Laura
I'm using it!
-speak Matt
Laser pointers, we have use.
Keyleth, you're up.
KEYLETH Okay, after seeing Grog get confused, I turn, and I go straight for his throat.
And I'm trying to drag him into the creek.
TRAVIS and
-speak Laura
Ooh.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Marisha
I wanna take the umber hulk into the creek right behind me.
-speak Matt
Okay, so go ahead and roll for a grapple.
-speak Marisha
All right.
-speak Travis
Come on, cave bear.
-speak Marisha
How do I grapple as a bear?
-speak Liam
Bear hug, man, bear hug.
-speak Laura
Yeah, just take him.
-speak Taliesin
How does one grapple as a bear?
It is a strength check, I guess.
-speak Matt
Does anyone else-- Can I have the book real fast?
Just to be sure we know how we're doing this.
-speak Taliesin
Have you noticed there's a rhinoceros in here?
-speak Marisha
I can be a rhinoceros.
-speak Matt
It's a contest, yes.
-speak Travis
Why have you not been a rhinoceros yet?
-speak Marisha
It just hasn't been useful yet.
-speak Sam
She usually picks a bird of some sort.
-speak Marisha
I'm waiting for the right time.
-speak Liam
She can only turn into things she's seen.
-speak Sam
I'm a squirrel and a bird!
You should be a rhinoceros.
-speak Taliesin
We're just waiting for you to scream, 
-speak Matt
It's morphin time!
-speak Matt
It's morphing time!
Bear!
-speak Marisha
Oh my god, can you make me smoke bombs that smoke, and I say, 
-speak Matt
It's morphin time
-speak Matt
?
-speak Matt
So you can make a grapple attempt in place of one of your attacks.
-speak Marisha
Okay.
That's what I want to do.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Marisha
So I just strength check then?
-speak Matt
So it is an athletics check.
-speak Marisha
Oh.
I don't have stats, I'm a bear.
-speak Matt
No, you use the bear's stats.
-speak Marisha
But all I have are the basic six.
-speak Matt
Right, what's the strength?
-speak Marisha
Five.
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Marisha
So that's what I do.
-speak Matt
Yeah, roll the dice, add plus five.
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Orion
It's 20!
-speak Matt
Natural 20.
-narrate
(clapping)
-speak Matt
You reach forward and latch onto it with your claws and your teeth, onto the umber hulk.
-speak Marisha
Going for the throat.
-speak Matt
Alright.
So that's your first attack.
You can go ahead while it's grappled and attack with the other strikes.
-speak Marisha
I'm taking him underwater.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You pull.
-speak Laura
Oh god, you're doing it, Keyleth.
-speak Marisha
Pulling him underwater.
-speak Liam
It's a waterfall, oh.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(imitates thudding)
-speak Matt
You both plunge underneath the water's surface.
Take a big old breath right beforehand, and I'm going underwater.
-speak Orion
Wait, can you let him go and let him drown?
-speak Laura
Yeah, let him go, 'cause it's a waterfall.
-speak Marisha
No, I'm holding on to him.
-speak Laura
But Keyleth, there's a waterfall.
It's fine.
-speak Matt
It's now its turn.
It's going to try and break your grapple.
-speak Matt
Make an athletics check.
-speak Marisha
Against his strength, I guess.
Ah, 20.
-speak Matt
20, okay.
You maintain your grip on the umber hulk.
It's thrashing in the water trying to get its way to the surface.
-narrate
(snarls)
-speak Matt
Still slashing about.
So it's gonna make its attacks against you.
-speak Matt
That is a 14.
-speak Marisha
Hits.
-speak Matt
14 hits you?
-speak Marisha
I'm a bear, my armor class is 12 right now.
-speak Matt
Well no, you keep your armor class.
-speak Marisha
I keep my armor class?
-speak Matt
I'm pretty sure.
-speak Liam
Yes, the answer to that is yes.
-speak Travis
Yeah, you do.
-speak Liam
Definitely yes.
-speak Matt
Nah, let's see real fast actually on this one.
-speak Sam
Keep subscribing to Geek & Sundry everybody.
-speak Matt
Exactly.
-speak Sam
We're going for 1,200 subscribers tonight, and if we reach that number.
.
.
good for you.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Here we go.
-speak Liam
Sam will write a ballad.
-speak Sam
I will.
-speak Matt
You gain the scores--
-speak Sam
By the way, this music is just great.
-speak Matt
It's 12 plus-- it's whatever the 12 is, plus your proficiency modifier, I think is what it is.
For now, we'll say it hits.
'Cause I don't wanna hold this up.
-speak Taliesin
There once was a player--
-speak Sam
In Nantucket?
-speak Laura
Don't.
-speak Matt
No, you gain its armor class.
-speak Marisha
I do gain its armor class.
-speak Matt
Yeah, you do.
-speak Marisha
So it hits.
-speak Matt
Yeah, it hits you.
All right.
Second strike.
That's also gonna hit you.
All three hit you.
You take six points of slashing damage.
11 points of slashing damage.
And six, 11, 17--
-speak Marisha
It's okay guys.
-speak Matt
Total of 26 points of slashing damage.
-speak Marisha
I am no longer a bear.
-speak Matt
So you lose your grip as your form reverts.
You are now back to Keyleth's form in the water.
-speak Sam
And you're in the water!
-speak Marisha
Can I cast a concentration spell on myself?
-speak Matt
No, because you used your actions to grapple it.
-speak Marisha
And that's it.
-speak Matt
So you're now just back in the Keyleth form, underwater.
You catch your breath and realize you're now underwater in near darkness with an umber hulk right on you.
-speak Marisha
Hey brah.
Sup?
Fancy meeting you here.
-speak Matt
Vax, you're up.
-speak Liam
Okay, so first thing I do is lean down and pick up the snail off the ground and say, 
-speak Matt
Hey, um, go fuck yourself.
-speak Matt
And then I throw him into the waterfall.
-speak Sam
Oh Jesus!
-speak Matt
Over here?
-speak Liam
Yeah.
-speak Matt
All right.
Go ahead and roll a ranged attack.
So just roll, add dexterity.
-speak Liam
Okay.
-speak Laura
Oh gosh, okay okay.
-speak Liam
Great great great.
Dexterity you say?
18.
-speak Matt
18?
-speak Laura
No, it's higher than that, yo!
-speak Orion
No, it's fine if he drowns and dies.
-speak Liam
Oh sorry, yeah, that's 21.
22, 22.
-speak Matt
You throw, it arcs over.
Lands in the water.
-narrate
(imitates water sucking)
-speak Matt
Goes under into the waterfall.
-speak Liam
Toodle-oo shitface.
-speak Sam
Hey wait, he
-narrate
(stutters)
-speak Sam
he swam away?
-speak Matt
No, he threw the snail over the waterfall.
-speak Sam
Hey!
Bye-bye!
-speak Liam
Now, that seems like a bonus action to me, right?
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
That's an attack.
-speak Liam
So then that's an attack, okay.
-speak Marisha
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Marisha
That's an attack.
-speak Matt
It's the world's easiest grapple throw.
-speak Travis
You threw him forever.
-speak Liam
Then I'm good.
-speak Laura
That's it?
-speak Liam
Well, that's my action, right?
-speak Matt
Correct.
-speak Liam
And I only have one.
-speak Sam
You can move, you can move.
-speak Liam
All right, so then, I'll hop through, through Percy and my sister.
And run up behind the shithead who's fucking with Keyleth.
-speak Matt
Make an acrobatics check, try to tumble through them.
-speak Liam
Yeah, that's easy.
-speak Orion
He's in the water, though.
-speak Liam
16
-narrate
(mumbles)
-speak Liam
29.
-speak Matt
Yeah, you're fine, and where do you wanna go?
-speak Liam
Right up behind shitface there.
And do I have anything left?
Or do I just get there and stop.
-speak Matt
Well, it was the attack to throw it.
You would have your second off-hand.
-speak Liam
Second attack.
Well let's stab him in the ass then, right.
-speak Matt
Well, you have disadvantage 'cause it's currently in the water thrashing about, and it's hard to see.
Well, that's not very good.
15.
-speak Matt
15 misses unfortunately.
So as you slash down with your dagger into the water, it's just too hard to really make out what that form moving is.
-speak Liam
I still feel pretty good about that round.
-speak Travis
Yeah, it was pretty good.
-speak Matt
Grog, you're up.
-speak Travis
Am I?
-narrate
(grunts)
-speak Travis
With my frenzied rage renewed, I run towards the water, haunted by nightmares of Sebastian in the Little Mermaid, and I leap into the water and start slashing and slashing.
-speak Matt
-narrate
Go ahead and make your three attacks, Grog.
(Liam sings opening notes to
-speak Matt
Under the Sea
-speak Matt
)
-speak Travis
♫ Le poisson, le poisson, hee hee hee, fuck you bitch ♫
-narrate
(Matt laughs)
-speak Travis
18 plus.
.
.
that's 26.
-speak Matt
26 hits.
-speak Travis
Okay, good.
Second attack.
26.
-speak Matt
Hits.
-speak Travis
Okay.
25.
-speak Matt
Hits.
-speak Travis
Good.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and roll damage, Grog.
As you come charging forward, just
-narrate
(grunts)
-speak Matt
, leaving bits of foam cascading off the side of your mouth.
Your eyes just glazed over with white.
You bring the axe down into the water, form towards where the splashing is.
Keeping mindful that Keyleth might be in there somewhere.
But you're very much see the larger form in the field, so.
-speak Travis
It's all about sushi right?
-speak Marisha
Oh, I'm fine.
-speak Matt
Yeah, so damage on the first strike?
-speak Travis
Eight, second one is 16.
-speak Matt
Eight, 16, that's 24.
-speak Travis
And 17, thirty.
What's 24 plus 10?
LAURA AND
-speak Matt
34.
-speak Matt
Grog.
34 points of damage.
As your axe comes down, slam once into the water.
You see one of the claws start pulling itself up out of the surface.
It's head's still under the water.
You slam the axe down.
You see the arm actually snaps and begins to drift down the river.
As it looks up at you, its eyes open.
Before the gaze can meet yours, the axe comes down and plunges itself directly into the forehead of the umber hulk with a shunk sound.
As it does, its body goes limp and begins to float down the water.
-narrate
(group cheers and claps)
-speak Laura
Well, that was easy.
-speak Sam
Was it?
-speak Laura
I walk up and try to help Keyleth out of the water.
-speak Matt
Okay.
You help Keyleth out of the water.
At this point, the snail form, which doesn't have a whole lot of hit points, has taken enough damage to alleviate itself from the polymorph.
As the spell fades, as the snail form is destroyed, the other umber hulk begins clawing its way up the side of the mountain, burrows through the actual stonework--
-speak Laura
Ah, balls.
-speak Matt
--
-narrate
(imitates explosion)
-speak Matt
and bursts out of the ground right behind you, Vax.
-narrate
(imitates explosion)
-speak Matt
LIAM: Oh, fuck a duck.
-speak Travis
Come on, drop this thing.
-speak Laura
This is why you shouldn't have thrown the snail.
-speak Matt
But that's its turn.
-speak Liam
I thought it would get washed all the way out.
Down the toilet, all the way out.
-speak Matt
All right, that brings us to the top of the round.
Tiberius.
-speak Marisha
It was at least badass.
-speak Liam
Elegant.
-speak Marisha
It was very elegant.
-speak Taliesin
I'm sure it was a wonderful thought.
-speak Orion
Firebolt.
-speak Matt
Okay, roll for it.
Roll for the attacks.
-speak Liam
Just past it, please.
-speak Matt
Yep, any directed spell like that you have to roll and add your spell range modifier.
-speak Orion
Sweet, that does not hit.
-speak Matt
What'd you roll?
-speak Orion
Uh, 11.
-speak Matt
Disadvantage, so.
You rolled an 11 total?
-speak Orion
10.
-speak Matt
Yeah, you miss.
So, as you aim your firebolt
-narrate
(imitated fire shooting)
-speak Matt
You're just averting your gaze, and it jumps over and arcs through the rest of the carvern, lighting it as it goes like a flare.
-speak Orion
Good cavern.
-speak Matt
That leads to Scanlan.
-speak Sam
Scanlan?
-speak Matt
Actually no, Vex is up and then Scanlan, sorry.
-speak Laura
Me?
-speak Matt
You, you.
-speak Liam
Kill it before it kills me.
Okay.
-speak Laura
I am gonna keep my gaze averted, but I just heard it, and I'm gonna--
-speak Orion
That rhymed.
-speak Laura
I'm gonna attack it.
WIth some arrows.
-speak Matt
Go for it.
So two arrows, notched.
-narrate
(imitates arrows firing)
-speak Matt
Disadvantage on each attack.
-speak Laura
Oh, okay.
-speak Liam
Don't let it eat my head, please.
-speak Laura
Yeah, it's the same.
18.
No, lying.
20.
-speak Matt
20 hits.
Go ahead and roll for the second attack.
-speak Laura
19.
-speak Matt
Both hit.
-speak Laura
Okay, good.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and roll damage on each.
-speak Laura
Is this the one that I Hunter's Marked?
No, the other one Hunter's Marked.
-speak Matt
The other one was, yeah.
-speak Laura
Okay, that's fine.
10 plus 13 is 23.
-speak Matt
But you could switch over your hunter's mark.
-speak Laura
And I switched over my Hunter's Mark as my bonus action.
-speak Matt
With your bonus action.
-speak Laura
So I add the-- oh, one.
-speak Matt
So a total of?
-speak Laura
24.
-speak Matt
24 points of damage.
All right, got you.
-narrate
(imitates arrows flying)
-speak Matt
The arrows end up piercing part of the armor.
Each sink in a good, solid six, seven inches or so.
It angrily
-narrate
(wet snarling)
-speak Matt
at the impact, but it wasn't enough force to send it back at all.
But it knows exactly where you are.
That brings us to Scanlan.
-speak Sam
Scanlan's gonna move right in front of where-- I believe that's Percy?
-speak Liam
Save the day, Scanny.
-speak Laura
Oh yeah, I should've ran Trinket up there.
-speak Liam
Repeat, just like last week.
-speak Sam
Toss another dice to Percy, he seems to need them.
-speak Taliesin
Thank you.
-speak Sam
And I'm gonna cast lightning bolt at the thing.
Who's wet from being in the water, yes?
So electricity is gonna be pretty bad on him.
-speak Matt
All right.
So, because you're kind of averting your gaze to look away--
-speak Sam
Disadvantage.
-speak Matt
No, because you don't roll to attack.
But it gets advantage on its saving throw because of that aspect.
-speak Matt
So, it rolled natural 20 for its saving, so it takes half damage.
But go ahead and roll your 8d6, it's the lighting bolt.
-speak Sam
8d6.
-speak Matt
Arcs out from your fingers.
-narrate
(imitates lightning)
-speak Sam
8d6, 8d6.
8d6?
!
-speak Taliesin
Yeah.
-speak Sam
Eight?
!
-speak Travis
Yeah.
-speak Liam
Yes.
-speak Sam
Shit!
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Sam
Uh, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Sam
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
-narrate
(mutters softly)
-speak Sam
28!
-speak Matt
28, okay.
14 points of damage to the umber hulk as the bolt of lightning cascades through its body.
It lights up for a second as you see the crawling fingers of electricity kind of shoot through its plates.
-speak Sam
I like crawling fingers.
-speak Matt
Indeed.
-speak Orion
That was the name of the one girl, wasn't it?
-speak Sam
Yes.
-speak Marisha
Oh, I loved Crawline, she was so nice.
-speak Matt
As the bolt grounds itself, the rest of the water on its form evaporates from the sheer force of the electricity.
You see the umber hulk still standing.
Angry, in pain, and standing, although it's still looking a little worse for wear.
You don't wanna do that to an umber hulk.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Sam
You're right.
-speak Matt
Percy, you're up.
-speak Taliesin
Taking my shot, I'm averting my eyes, so.
-speak Sam
Use those dice, use those dice.
-speak Marisha
Whoo!
-speak Taliesin
24 to hit.
-speak Matt
That was the disadvantage?
-speak Taliesin
At the disadvantage.
-speak Matt
Awesome, that hits.
-speak Taliesin
That's 1d8 plus five.
That's, ugh, that's terrible.
That's six points of damage.
I'm taking my second shot.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Liam
Shoot it in the mouth.
-narrate
(clapping)
-speak Marisha
Oh wait, but it's disadvantage.
-speak Taliesin
I rolled twice.
So I rolled a 19 and a 20, which means--
-speak Marisha
Which are both your critical, right?
Which are both my criticals.
So a critical at a disadvantage.
-speak Travis
Sick, nasty.
-speak Taliesin
Just point, nyah, nyah!
-speak Liam
Yes Percy.
Critical on a disadvantage!
-speak Matt
Well done.
-speak Taliesin
So I'm also gonna spend my die.
-speak Liam
Whatever your last name is again.
-speak Sam
The die is for the attack.
-speak Matt
It's for attacks, skills, and saving throws, not for damage.
-speak Taliesin
That's, uh.
.
.
five, six, seven, eight, that's 11 points of damage.
-speak Travis
Finish him.
-speak Matt
11 points of damage from the first one.
-speak Taliesin
11 points of damage from the second one.
-speak Marisha
But that one's critical.
So it doubles, right?
-speak Taliesin
It's just 1d8 becomes 2d8, right?
-speak Matt
Correct, yeah.
-speak Taliesin
Yeah that's-- yeah.
-speak Matt
Okay, it's 11 points damage.
Gotcha.
So, as you rear back your shot
-narrate
(imitates gun firing)
-speak Matt
it resounds.
It hits the plate, shatters it on the other side of its chest.
You can now see this weird purplish goo beginning to spill from its wounds.
You see it's holding itself up, and it's having a hard time keeping physical form there.
Keyleth, you're up.
-speak Marisha
Oh.
Um, cool.
-narrate
(Liam laughs)
-speak Orion
Word.
-speak Marisha
Word.
I'm still a person.
I'm gonna go ahead and also do a call lighting spell.
Bam, call lightning right on its head.
'Cause he's wet.
-speak Matt
Call lighting it is.
-speak Matt
So, as you begin to complete your spell, you can see now the upper arch, the 100 foot archway, the ceiling of this area begins to fill with this strange cloudy, thunderous booms, as a raincloud is created and summoned across the rooftop.
At which point, Keyleth frees her hand up and pulls down as a single bolt streaks through the air, slamming into the same lightning bolt wound that you left previously on it, where the edges of its armor are still glowing from the heat.
Go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Marisha
Got him right in the ass.
It just gets straight damage?
-speak Matt
Yeah, it gets a bonus on its saving throw, though.
Or advantage.
Which it makes.
-speak Marisha
I get 3d10.
-speak Matt
3d10.
All right, go for it.
-speak Marisha
Six, seven--
-speak Matt
It is no longer outdoors-only.
-speak Matt
It gets a bonus for being outdoors.
-speak Marisha
11 damage.
-speak Matt
11 damage to the umber hulk.
Which is halved.
He made a saving throw, to a six.
-speak Marisha
Saving throw, mm.
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Travis
Finish him.
Cause you're having to avert your gaze.
You're trying to work out this whole thing where you're all basically at a severe disadvantage fighting this thing, unless you want to be completely fucked over.
All right.
-speak Sam
Should have created sunglasses for him or something.
-speak Travis
We have two of its eyes.
-speak Matt
It's now its turn.
-speak Laura
Ugh, it's still alive.
-speak Matt
It turns and runs past, to the one who shot it with the angry lightning bolt.
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Matt
The tiny gnome that now is a delicious morsel in the mandibles of an umber hulk.
It comes running forward like a giant armored gorilla.
-narrate
(grunts)
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-speak Matt
Reaching back with both of its claws, swiping at you Scanlan, that is a 23 to hit.
-speak Sam
Oh, yeah.
-speak Matt
25 to hit.
-speak Matt
Its mandibles are 24 to hit.
-speak Sam
That hits three times.
-speak Matt
Yep.
You take 13--
-speak Laura
Oh, no!
-speak Liam
But you're so little.
-speak Matt
24.
-speak Sam
Ooh!
-speak Matt
38 points of slashing damage.
This is the sound I make.
-narrate
(high-pitched wail)
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
As it just strikes you, all of its form now, you're almost pinned to the ground, blood oozing from your face as gashes, slash wounds are across your entire body.
It's looming over you, ready to try and finish you off next round.
-speak Laura
Ugh!
-speak Matt
That brings us to Vax.
-speak Liam
Okay.
So, he's now got his back turned to me.
I'm just gonna stick both knives into his guts and say, 
-speak Matt
No one touches the gnome!
-speak Liam
Right in his guts, that's shit.
So, fuck that.
And this one is way better.
So that's 27.
-speak Matt
27 hits definitely.
-speak Liam
Okay, this is the flametongue.
-speak Matt
It is considered flanking, because Scanlan is there.
Oh yes.
-speak Liam
Four plus two is six.
-narrate
(Sam sings along with dramatic music)
-speak Liam
Two, three, fuck, four, fuck, seven, nine, 18, 24 damage.
With the second knife, sneak attack into his ball sack.
-speak Matt
How do you want to do this?
-narrate
(group yells triumphantly)
-speak Liam
I stick it in the back of his spider nads.
And rip it out his bum and out the back of him.
-speak Laura
Gross!
-speak Liam
And just spill it all out the bottom.
-narrate
(all talking at once)
-speak Sam
I'm right next to him, it might spill on me.
-speak Liam
That's all right, that's all right.
-speak Matt
As it's looming over Scanlan who's on his back, it's tearing into him and starting to gut him best it can.
He's screaming from beneath.
You rush underneath, tumble, bringing your dagger up and slam it right under the bottom of its abdomen.
-speak Laura
Balls.
-speak Matt
As you do it,
-narrate
(snarls)
-speak Matt
, looks down towards you and right before its gaze can meet yours, you yank back with all your might, basically scissoring and jagged drawing the blade up the back of its body.
As you do it,
-narrate
(imitates vomiting)
-speak Matt
leaps forward.
It's now-soft torso and belly left open from the armor plates being shot off, spills a number of its warm innards right onto Scanlan's body and form.
-speak Sam
Ugh, no!
It went in my mouth!
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Matt
And then it collapses on top of him.
.
-speak Sam
Ah!
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
You take six points of crushing damage as the umber hulk collapses on top of you.
-speak Travis
I run over and shove the umber hulk off of Scanlan.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Sam
Ugh!
Ah!
-speak Laura
Oh my gosh.
-speak Sam
What just happened?
-speak Marisha
I go over to Scanlan, and I just, I just lay my hands on him, and I cast Cure Wounds in a level two spot.
-speak Liam
Nobody touches my man-wife.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Sam
What's that spell do?
-speak Marisha
You do-- it's 2d8 plus 10 healing.
-speak Sam
You roll, right?
-speak Taliesin
Yep.
-speak Marisha
Do I roll or does he?
-speak Matt
For which spell is this?
-speak Marisha
I'm doing Cure Wounds on him.
At level two.
-speak Matt
Cure Wounds, level two?
2d8 plus five.
-speak Marisha
Do I roll?
-speak Matt
You roll.
-speak Marisha
So you heal, 16, 20 points.
-speak Sam
Thank you.
-speak Matt
So, as you heal him, touch him with the spell, you wipe the umber hulk ichor off of your hand.
-speak Orion
I cast prestidigitation and clean everybody up.
-speak Laura
Maybe you should jump in that water, Scanlan.
-speak Travis
You should get in the water and clean yourself off.
-speak Taliesin
We have running water.
Use running water.
-speak Sam
I think I wanna keep it on.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Orion
He's clean already.
-speak Travis
As a badge of honor?
-speak Sam
It's a badge of honor.
-speak Liam
Like the walking dead, you're gonna sneak by the rest of 'em?
-speak Sam
I think I'm gonna keep the blood on me, if you don't mind.
-speak Laura
Alright.
-speak Matt
That's, uh.
.
.
okay.
-speak Travis
Gross.
-speak Sam
Warning to others.
-speak Marisha
Yeah.
-speak Matt
So, you still hear the rushing of the water down below.
You now stand at this portion of the cavern, the dull glow in the distance of some sort of light source in that direction.
The rest of the caverns opens up this way.
-speak Laura
Ugh.
-speak Travis
Let's go towards the light.
-speak Sam
Can we take a short rest and heal up?
-speak Travis
No, I run.
-speak Laura
Short rest, short rest.
-speak Travis
No, running.
-speak Liam
Running?
!
-narrate
(Sam laughs)
-speak Sam
Why don't you let some people heal?
-speak Matt
Grog goes running.
Grog, who's interested.
-speak Travis
I'm frenzy raging.
-speak Sam
Oh God, Grog!
Grog, no!
-speak Travis
It's a bright, shiny thing.
I'm going there!
-speak Laura
He is frenzying.
-speak Liam
I'm unscathed, so I run after Grog, just to give him backup if he needs.
-speak Marisha
I'll follow after Vax.
-speak Matt
All right, you guys head out.
Eventually, you come around the corner to see what looks like a campfire.
-speak Orion
I follow as well.
-speak Travis
Aww.
-speak Matt
It looks like a setup with a small bundle of, what looks like bedding.
There's a campfire set up.
It's mostly out at this point.
Like there's still a little bit of a flame flicker to it, but it's just embers for the most part.
Does not appear--
-speak Travis
I start hacking away at the bedding.
Just chopping the shit out of it.
-speak Sam
Jesus!
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Grog starts hacking away at the bedding.
-narrate
(Travis grunts)
-speak Liam
I'm just watching and shrugging.
-speak Laura
No, look and search around and see what's in the bedding.
-speak Liam
I try to keep like six or seven foot difference--
-speak Matt
-narrate
(arrows whooshing)
-speak Sam
Oh, no!
-speak Liam
Fuck!
-speak Matt
Three crossbow bolts come flying out of nowhere--
-speak Liam
You dick!
-speak Matt
--two hitting Grog.
-speak Liam
You dick!
-narrate
(Marisha laughs)
-speak Laura
Why weren't you stealthing?
-speak Liam
I am now.
-speak Travis
Somebody likes their bedding apparently.
-speak Liam
I rolled a 29 of stealth as soon as the first arrow flew.
-speak Marisha
That was a Coleman, alright?
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Marisha
That was a very expensive sleeping bag.
-speak Taliesin
Never attack the bedding before you know the thread count.
-speak Travis
It was 3,000 count Egyptian.
-speak Taliesin
God.
-speak Matt
Grog, you take seven points of piercing damage, which is halved to four because you're raging.
-speak Travis
Right.
-narrate
(grunts)
-speak Matt
As you can see what looks like three small--
-speak Liam
Duergar.
-speak Laura
No, they're dwarves.
-speak Liam
Yeah, that's duergar.
That's dark dwarves.
-speak Laura
Oh!
-speak Liam
I consider myself a nerd.
-speak Matt
And some strange beast you've not seen before seems to be accompanying one of them.
-speak Laura
Is that a brain?
-speak Matt
It looks like an oversized, swollen brain with a set of claws.
-speak Liam
It's hanging brain.
-speak Sam
Krang?
-speak Marisha
Brain?
-speak Matt
It's just like a large brain with a set of arms and legs like a panther.
-speak Laura
What?
-speak Travis
It's the brain bug from Starship Troopers.
-speak Marisha
That can't be good.
-speak Orion
Take that out first.
-speak Matt
Going off the same intiative order.
They've gone.
-speak Liam
I rolled a 29 stealth.
-speak Matt
Yes, I know.
So you haven't been seen, and you have the first action.
-speak Travis
Are they on the same level as us?
-speak Matt
They are, yes.
-speak Liam
So I can dash and still attack?
-speak Matt
If you'd like to.
-speak Liam
I would love to.
I would love to, uh-- where's this thing?
-speak Laura
Go for the brain.
-speak Liam
Yeah, of course go for the brain.
I'm gonna hang brain.
I'm gonna run over--
-speak Matt
Well if you dash as your action--
-speak Liam
Oh, I can't stealth?
So to stay stealth, I need to go normal speed?
-speak Matt
Well you can dash as your action, but dash is your, basically a double move.
So you move and use your action to move as well.
-speak Liam
And that's it.
-speak Matt
That's all you'll be able to do.
-speak Liam
Um, I'm gonna-- no.
I'll you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go-- hey, god.
I'm gonna move over here, stealthily.
And go for ready.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Liam
That's what it's called, right?
And wait?
-speak Matt
Just wait.
-speak Liam
And the trigger is when this asshole duergar moves forward, I'm gonna stick him in the back of the neck.
-speak Matt
Okay.
All right.
-speak Marisha
Nice.
-speak Matt
Tiberius.
You hear Grog go, 
-speak Matt
Ugh!
-speak Orion
Oh, it seems like there's trouble over there.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Orion
What has Grog gotten himself into?
-speak Marisha
I don't know.
-narrate
(Travis moans and strangles)
-speak Orion
I saunter--
-speak Travis
You saunter?
-speak Sam
Saunter.
-speak Orion
Yes.
-speak Matt
You jump off your pillar.
-speak Orion
Oh.
-speak Matt
Saunter over here?
-speak Orion
Yeah, I would go around there to-- That's good, I suppose.
What's in between the-- between him and that.
Is that a boulder?
-speak Matt
It's a giant raised stalagmite.
-speak Orion
I see, how tall is that?
-speak Matt
It's about 25 feet tall.
-speak Orion
Oh crap, okay.
-speak Matt
All you see is Grog standing with three bolts sticking out of his chest now.
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-narrate
(Travis imitates wood breaking)
-speak Orion
I can't do anything too much.
-speak Liam
Grog, I've got the hiccups.
-speak Matt
Anything else, Tiberius?
Gotta keep this moving.
-speak Travis
Yeah.
-speak Liam
The bolts.
-speak Travis
Right.
-speak Orion
I'll just cast stoneskin on myself.
Okay, Stoneskin cast on you.
That brings us to Vex.
-speak Laura
All right, I can hear them screaming so I'm gonna run over.
Call Trinket as I'm doing it.
-speak Travis
Who's screaming?
-speak Laura
You, you screamed.
-speak Travis
No, I'm not screaming.
-speak Matt
Do you want to use your full round to move?
Cause that's as far as you can move currently.
Actually you can move two more.
-speak Laura
Can I see anything from that point?
-speak Matt
All you see is Grog over there.
-speak Liam
They're covered and he's around the bend, so I'd run in further.
-speak Laura
All right, I'll run in further.
Can I run in and stealth or is that it?
-speak Matt
Uh, you can attempt to.
-speak Laura
I'm gonna try to stealth as I'm going in.
-speak Matt
You're at disadvantage on the stealth roll, but go for it.
-speak Laura
Oh, a 20.
Aw!
17, okay.
Plus my stealth, which is five.
-speak Matt
All right, so we'll say you're pulled off to the side there.
The stealth twins over there being all stealthy-like.
No one can see what's going on with them.
It's like they're related.
-speak Travis
What's all this stealthing?
Where's all the killing?
-speak Matt
That's your turn.
-speak Laura
I can't attack anything.
-speak Matt
Scanlan.
-speak Sam
Okay, I'm gonna move right there into the room as far as I can.
-speak Matt
You can go that far.
-speak Sam
Okay.
And cast Stinking Cloud right there.
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Sam
It's gonna smell like just ass over there.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Okay.
Best you can see, and you haven't really seen where they are, so you're kind of like, oh, you have the idea that perhaps they're over in that vicinity on the bolts around there.
So you can cast over in this area, which is the only thing you have view of.
-speak Sam
Oh, oh, because that's a big rock in my view there.
-speak Matt
This is a big rock right there, yeah.
-speak Sam
Okay, so yeah.
I'll put it right where you're saying, right there, yeah.
-speak Matt
Okay, that's about where you can go.
All right, so
-narrate
(hisses)
-speak Matt
, a giant--
-speak Travis
Ass cloud.
-speak Matt
--green, ass cloud--
-speak Orion
Scanlan, are you doing an ass cloud again?
-speak Matt
--begins to fill this space here.
As it does, they all begin to hack and cough.
You can hear this now between the rest of you, echoing throughout.
-speak Travis
I'm slightly aroused.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Orion
I was just going to say.
-speak Travis
I'm drawn to the smell.
-speak Sam
-narrate
(imitates flute)
-speak Sam
--stinks.
-speak Matt
♫ Constitution saving throws.
Everything in the cloud.
♫
-speak Sam
-narrate
(imitates flute)
-speak Sam
--stink.
-speak Matt
♫ All them are failing.
♫
-speak Orion
Doing stink magic.
-speak Matt
All right.
You hear a cacophonous amount of hacking, coughing, as all of them drop their attack stances and begin just retching, nearly vomiting, in the middle of this green cloud of gas.
-speak Travis
Outstanding.
-speak Sam
I'll also take a great heal potion?
Is that what they're called?
Not moderate.
-speak Matt
Yes, greater.
-speak Sam
Great, greater, okay.
I'll do that by myself.
You keep going.
-speak Matt
Okay, greater heal potion is 4d4 plus four.
-speak Sam
Thank you.
-speak Matt
All right, that brings us to Percy.
-speak Taliesin
I'm going to start crawling around the-- I have a little thingy.
Someone took the thingy.
Oh, laser pointer.
Thank you.
-speak Liam
Hello, hey.
-speak Travis
It's a black light.
-speak Taliesin
I'm gonna start heading down this direction, and I'm going to actually spend a movement, spend my action and move a little further down, about, yeah, about there, so I can start getting a good look of what's up.
-speak Matt
Okay, good.
All right.
That brings us to Keyleth.
-speak Marisha
Okay, so I am going to take this and move up to about here, I guess.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Marisha
Is where I can see.
And then I'm gonna take this little block of stone right here, this stalagtite or mite or whatever it is--
-speak Matt
Correct.
-speak Marisha
--and I'm gonna use Wall of Stone.
And instead of creating a wall, I'm just gonna take that one and I'm gonna push it
-narrate
(imitates thudding)
-speak Marisha
against that wall and try and crush those guys.
-speak Travis
Whoa!
-speak Matt
Wait, you're gonna use Wall of Stone to try and push that back?
-speak Marisha
I'm gonna take this wall, and I'm gonna go crunch.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Sam
Oh my God.
-speak Travis
Can you do that?
-speak Taliesin
That's kinda harsh.
-speak Marisha
I don't know.
We'll find out.
-speak Laura
I like that that's the most common quip.
-speak Matt
Can, can you do that?
-speak Sam
You can actually do that?
-speak Orion
It's like earthbending.
-speak Marisha
I'm trying to earthbend this wall.
-speak Sam
Hey Grog.
Did you ever write down our underwater spell, potion thingies, whatever those were called?
-speak Travis
We got two of 'em.
-speak Sam
Yeah, did you right it down, though?
'Cause I didn't.
-speak Travis
What they were?
-speak Taliesin
She's got waterbreathing, so.
-speak Matt
So how it works is, Wall of Stone, you can create a wall of stone, but it cannot occupy the space of a creature.
So you will not be able to push them back, unfortunately.
But you could lock them into an area, if that's what you wanted to do.
-speak Sam
The man telling us what we can and can't do.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
It's the nature of the spell, guys.
-speak Marisha
Yeah, that's a waste of time.
Instead, I will-- I still got a Call Lightning going.
Fuck it.
I'm just gonna lightning bolt some bitches.
-speak Matt
All right.
You don't have view of any of them right now, unfortunately.
-speak Marisha
Well, then I move to where I can.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Sam
Yeah good.
Cop attitude with the DM.
-speak Travis
Yeah, yeah.
-speak Sam
The man in charge of our fates.
-speak Taliesin
That always goes really well.
-speak Matt
That'll be your turn.
-speak Sam
Because of the attitude.
-speak Matt
You moved twice.
You had to get a long distance.
-speak Marisha
Did I?
-speak Matt
Yeah, because you were back here.
-speak Laura
Yeah, dude.
It was really far away, yo.
I've got a decent speed, okay, fine.
That's my turn then.
-speak Matt
Sorry.
-speak Liam
Fuck those Wizards of the Coast, man!
I do what I wanna do.
-speak Marisha
Fucking Seattle assholes.
-speak Matt
All right, so.
-speak Orion
I love Seattle.
-speak Liam
So do I.
-speak Matt
And what's the DC again of your spell?
-speak Sam
Ah, oh.
-speak Sam
Spell save DC, is that right?
19.
-speak Matt
19.
All right.
All three of the-- and you can now get a view of them.
They are dwarven, but their skin is ashy and grey.
Their eyes are white and pupil-less.
And they are all on the verge of vomiting right now.
They're both just keeling over.
One of them tries to bring a crossbow up, and
-narrate
(imitates vomiting)
-speak Matt
has to put it back down again.
They are unable to act this turn.
The weird brain creature, however--
-speak Marisha
That's awesome.
-speak Travis
What, has no nostrils?
-speak Taliesin
There's nowhere for him to retch from.
-speak Matt
It moves out of the cloud, looks over at you Grog.
-speak Sam
Oh, no.
-speak Matt
And just bears down for a second.
And you feel this.
.
.
intrusion in your mind.
-speak Travis
On my professor-torial mind.
-speak Matt
Go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
-speak Sam
Oh, those aren't good for you.
-speak Marisha
Oh, no.
-narrate
(Travis laughs)
-speak Taliesin
Well this, this ends poorly.
-speak Travis
Oh good, my modifier's negative two, so yippee-kye-ay-eh.
Six.
-speak Matt
Alright.
-speak Orion
Good roll.
-speak Taliesin
Good roll.
-speak Marisha
That's a good number.
-speak Matt
You suffer nine points of psychic damage as there's a sudden blast of excruciating pain in the center of your brain.
It actually shakes you a moment from your rage, which then fills your mind once again.
-speak Travis
Like Kenny G music coming through my brain.
-speak Taliesin
Someone needs a Juggernaut helmet.
-speak Matt
Also, you suffer--
-speak Marisha
He needs a Magneto helmet.
-speak Taliesin
Yeah, he needs the full Magneto.
-speak Matt
--eight points of intelligence damage technically.
You immediately fall unconscious.
-narrate
(Laura gasps)
-speak Marisha
What?
!
-speak Matt
Your intelligence is brought to zero.
-speak Travis
Ah!
But I was at six!
-speak Liam
You gotta kill that thing.
-speak Laura
Oh no!
-speak Travis
I turn into a turnip?
-speak Matt
That brings us to--
-narrate
(Matt laughs)
-speak Matt
Tiberius.
-speak Orion
Tiberius, I mean--
-speak Matt
Yes, you're Tiberius.
-speak Orion
I say--
-speak Matt
You just watched Grog just go
-narrate
(groans)
-speak Matt
and fall to the ground.
Almost into the campfire.
-speak Laura
Oh, no.
-speak Travis
It's like when I tried to read 50 Shades of Grey.
-narrate
(groans)
-speak Orion
Okay, I'm gonna--
-speak Taliesin
Around the bear.
-speak Orion
Okay, I'm gonna go right up to where Grog is.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Orion
Right there, right in front of him.
Now can I see the brain fucker?
-speak Matt
Yes, you can from there.
-speak Marisha
The brain fucker.
-speak Matt
The brain fucker's official name.
-speak Taliesin
Brain lover, brain lover.
-speak Orion
Ooh, you're a nasty one.
-speak Marisha
He's a lover, not a fighter.
-speak Orion
I'm gonna fire a glacial blast at this dude.
-speak Matt
Okay.
Single targeted beam.
-speak Taliesin
Lobey.
-speak Marisha
Lobey.
-speak Taliesin
We're gonna name him Lobey.
-speak Marisha
Let's call him Lobey.
-narrate
(Laura laughs)
-speak Matt
Makes its saving throw.
-speak Taliesin
Lobey, no!
-speak Matt
What's your DC?
-speak Orion
My DC is 17.
-speak Matt
It just rolled a 17, yeah.
It makes the saving throw.
So half damage.
-speak Taliesin
Take him everywhere.
-speak Orion
Four, six, and 8d6.
-speak Taliesin
Our little Lobey.
-speak Marisha
Can we call him Jeff, Jeff Lobey?
-speak Sam
Is that campfire still firing?
-speak Taliesin
Jeff Lobey.
-speak Matt
It's embers, yeah.
21, 22, 23.
24, 26, 27, 22.
29 damage.
-speak Matt
29 damage?
-narrate
(Taliesin laughing)
-speak Matt
As you put your arms out, you focus this blast of just freezing cold arcane energy that slams into the side of this brain creature.
-speak Taliesin
Jeff Lobey, thank you.
-speak Matt
As it does, you see it begins to freeze its entire body.
As it reaches up and tries to climb up it solidifies and then shatters into a hundred million pieces.
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Sam
Oh, the brain's dead.
-speak Taliesin
You killed Jeff Lobey!
-speak Marisha
You killed Jeff Lobey.
-speak Sam
Lisa Loeb?
-speak Marisha
Lisa Lobey!
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Marisha
They just keep going!
-speak Matt
Lisa Loeb and then the nine intelligence damage.
All right.
So the brain just
-narrate
(imitates shattering)
-speak Matt
cascades across the ground.
-speak Liam
Lisa Lobey.
-speak Matt
And thank God.
Vex, you're now seeing three dwarves retching and coughing over, kind of looking about very nervously.
-speak Laura
Can I move to where I can get a line of site on that one?
-speak Matt
On this one here?
-speak Laura
Yeah.
-speak Matt
Yeah, you can move to there and get a line of sight.
-speak Laura
Okay cool, then I'm gonna shoot him.
Oh wait, no, I can't.
-speak Sam
Why?
-speak Laura
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm gonna do that.
-speak Liam
You still have a little bit of cover.
-speak Laura
I'm gonna do-- it's fine, I got it.
I'm really good.
-speak Liam
Just be a badass, okay?
That's your job.
-speak Laura
Okay.
27.
-speak Matt
That hits.
-speak Liam
Are you alright, big guy?
-speak Liam
Muh!
-speak Laura
Oh, I should've tried to-- it's okay.
-speak Liam
Muh!
Muh!
-speak Sam
It's weird, Grog weirdly seems smarter now than he was before.
-speak Laura
Hunter's Mark on that guy.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Sam
Beep boop.
-speak Matt
Good remembering.
-speak Marisha
Professor Grog's having a hard time.
-speak Laura
11.
-speak Matt
11, all right.
-speak Laura
11, and then I'm gonna hit him again.
And that's a 23.
-speak Matt
All right.
-speak Laura
And that is nine damage for that arrow.
And then the six for a Hunter's Mark is five.
-speak Matt
So a total of.
.
.
?
-speak Laura
Oh jeez-louise, 30 plus five is.
.
.
35.
-speak Matt
-narrate
(imitates arrows flying)
-speak Matt

-speak Matt
Ugh!
-speak Matt
The hacking, coughing duergar dwarf is like,
-narrate
(coughs)
-speak Matt
One in the shoulder, and the other shoulder.
And it looks like that you,
-narrate
(inhales sharply)
-speak Matt
As it inhales a big old whiff of horrible stinking cloud gas, the arrow
-narrate
(imitates arrow flying)
-speak Matt
through its throat and out the back of its head.
Falls flat on its back.
-speak Laura
Yeah.
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Matt
The other ones look nervously about.
-speak Marisha
Get him a pillow!
What!
-speak Matt
One of them's just coughing out, saying something in Undercommon.
-narrate
(speaks in angry gibberish)
-speak Matt
Anyone here speak Undercommon?
-speak Laura
I do!
-speak Matt
You do?
-speak Sam
You speak Undercommon?
-speak Laura
I do.
-speak Taliesin
Oondercommon.
-speak Laura
I knew we were gonna be going down into some--
-speak Matt
You hear him say, 
-speak Matt
Quick, there's our exit!
Back, back to the master.
-speak Laura
-narrate
(whispering)
-speak Laura
Back to the master!
-speak Travis
Who's the master?
-speak Laura
You're unconscious.
-speak Matt
All right.
That brings us to Scanlan.
-speak Sam
Ah, shit.
I did not understand them, right?
So I don't know that they're going to run.
-speak Matt
No.
-speak Travis
Let 'em run back to the master and we'll track 'em.
-speak Sam
I didn't learn that they're running, so.
Can I call out that I heard them?
Say, 
-speak Matt
Don't let them run!
-speak Matt
No, this happening just as you heard them.
-speak Sam
Okay, well.
I don't have a good line of sight on them, so I don't even know that they're there really, right?
I just hear coughing in the distance.
-speak Matt
Yep.
Then I'll just move further into the cavern there.
And I don't know that this works, but I'll try to cast Dispel Magic on Grog.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Sam
I don't know if that, if it's magic.
I have no idea.
-speak Matt
So you go ahead and you focus, you cast Dispel Magic in Grog's vicinity.
-speak Sam
♫ Wake up, Grog ♫
-speak Matt
You see the shift of arcane, waving energy.
-speak Travis
♫ If I only had a brain ♫
-speak Matt
It does not seem to have an effect.
-speak Sam
It doesn't do it!
Damn it!
Then as my bonus action, can I still give him an inspiration dice to do on like saving.
.
.
?
-speak Matt
You think at this point, Grog isn't unconscious.
Grog is catatonic.
Grog has no intelligence.
There is nothing home.
You see him, on the ground, drooling, eyes glazed over.
There is nothing there.
-speak Taliesin
You can't inspire a cantaloupe.
-speak Laura
What are we gonna do?
-speak Taliesin
The cantaloupe, it's not gonna feel better about itself.
-speak Sam
Okay, then I give my dice to Vax.
-speak Taliesin
I've tried insulting a cantaloupe, you just don't get anywhere.
-speak Sam
Vax, I've just inspired you.
-narrate
(imitates flute)
-speak Matt
I think the chat room's catching on for those who know D&D well.
-speak Liam
Okay, I hear a little shithead grey-skinned dwarf--
-speak Sam
Wait, it's not your turn.
I just gave you dice.
I thought you said Vax.
Okay, sorry.
-speak Matt
It's all right.
So that ends Scanlan's turn.
Percy.
-speak Liam
Damn it.
-speak Taliesin
Laser.
I'm going to take my laser.
-speak Matt
Your laser?
Point your laser?
-narrate
(Liam imitates ray gun)
-speak Taliesin
All right, I want to crawl forward to the other side of Grog over there, so I can see this little jerk.
-speak Matt
It's a tough call, he has cover.
You can still see him.
-speak Taliesin
I ignore cover.
It's one of my magical things that I do.
-speak Liam
Three-quarters cover according to the new rules.
-speak Marisha
Yeah, he's got a gun.
-speak Taliesin
Yeah, I ignore half or three-quarters cover.
-speak Matt
Then you can ignore three-quarters cover, which he has.
So, yes.
-speak Taliesin
Okay, I ignore it.
I'm also going to take a penalty to my attack bonus to attempt to do some damage and to not kill, but injure, if possible.
-speak Matt
Okay.
-speak Taliesin
I wanna leave one for questioning.
-speak Matt
Okay.
So go ahead and roll disadvantage on this attack.
Or do you want to just do subdual damage, which is what you're doing?
-speak Taliesin
Yeah.
All right, so you're gonna aim in a way that doesn't do lethal damage.
Go for it.
-speak Matt
It's a normal attack, there's no penalty to it.
-speak Taliesin
Just my penalty for extra damage.
-speak Matt
Mm hm.
-speak Taliesin
Aha!
I crit!
So that's fun.
Let's roll damage.
Nine, 10, that's 25 points of damage.
-speak Laura
Yeah!
-speak Matt
25 points of damage.
All right, you run around the corner, pull the gun out, and aim at this like--
-narrate
(coughs)
-speak Matt
Where you look now, you see this ghastly looking, evil, female-looking grey-skinned dwarf.
Looks over at you and
-narrate
(gasps)
-speak Matt
reacts and goes for her weapon.
As you do, you let loose and fire straight into her shoulder, blasting through most of her shoulder, exposing bone.
It's not a deahtblow, but you see she has been incapacitated.
-speak Orion
Nice.
-speak Taliesin
That's my turn.
-speak Laura
I call out, 
-speak Matt
Let one of them live, so I can question them.
-speak Taliesin
That's-- we got one.
-speak Matt
Keyleth, you're up.
-speak Marisha
We got one?
-speak Taliesin
We got one.
-speak Marisha
Well, then.
-speak Matt
That dwarf survived.
With one hit point.
-speak Marisha
If we got the guy we need.
I will move over a bit.
Yeah.
And.
.
.
-narrate
(imitates energy firing)
-speak Matt
All right, go for it.
-speak Liam
Vines?
-speak Matt
First off, make a constitution save, 'cause you stepped into a stinking cloud.
Unless you wanna move back here.
There you go.
-speak Marisha
Not having control.
-speak Matt
Laser pointer.
-speak Marisha
I do
-narrate
(mumbles)
-speak Marisha
.
Okay.
So that is.
.
.
what is that?
22?
-speak Matt
22 points of damage.
All right.
So the bolt streaks from the cloud in the sky, slamming into this other duergar.
As it sparks into the ground, you see bits of stone get thrown up from the sheer force of the bolt, doing a sincere amount of damage to it.
Not enough to finish it, but it looks very, very fucked up.
You can see part of its face is charred now, and it's reeling from the blast.
Probably blew out its eardrums from the cacophonous blast of the thunder.
-speak Marisha
That's my turn.
-speak Matt
That's your turn.
It's now both of their turn.
They both failed their saves with a two and a four.
They're both still hacking and coughing in the stinking cloud.
Uh, go bards.
Vax, you're up.
-speak Liam
Okay, and there's a big cloud of poo stink around them, so--
-speak Matt
Correct, so all here.
-speak Orion
The poo cloud,
-speak Liam
God dammit.
All right.
-speak Marisha
Do I?
-speak Matt
The poo cloud.
-speak Liam
Fuck it.
-speak Sam
Just go in there, man.
-speak Liam
I'm gonna hold my breath, and I'm gonna go one, two, three, four, five, and grab this guy around the neck and hold my daggers to his neck.
And just hunker down and try to hold him hostage.
-speak Matt
Okay.
Go ahead and make a constitution check.
-speak Travis
A dirty mafia check?
-speak Liam
Is that a, is that a--
-speak Matt
With advantage, because you're holding your breath.
-speak Liam
Okay.
14.
-speak Travis
Just breathe it in.
-speak Sam
Use the dice!
Use the dice!
-speak Liam
What did you give me?
-speak Sam
A d8.
-speak Liam
22.
-speak Sam
No, it's not an eight.
A d8.
You gotta roll it.
-speak Matt
Roll a d8 to add to it.
-speak Liam
15.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Liam
It came up a one.
-speak Travis
22!
-speak Matt
So, as you rush in the cloud,
-narrate
(breathes deeply)
-speak Matt
you run in, pull your daggers out, and because this isn't a natural cloud, the arcane force puts it in your nostrils and you can't help yourself.
-narrate
(coughs)
-speak Matt
Your turn immediately ends as you begin feeling your lunch retching up into your stomach.
-speak Travis
Puke on him.
-speak Matt
Okay.
That brings us to Grog.
You are a--
-speak Travis
Oh, I got it.
-narrate
(blows raspberry)
-speak Matt
You are brain-dead.
-narrate
(group laughs)
-speak Matt
Tiberius, you're up.
-speak Laura
So sorry, Grog.
-speak Sam
Can we heal him, what is it?
What do we need to do?
-speak Marisha
We'll figure that out when we kill this guy, I guess.
-speak Laura
Restoration?
-speak Liam
Can you dispel that shit?
-speak Sam
I tried, I tried.
-speak Marisha
He can't dispel it, It's not magic.
But I might be able to cure him afterwards.
-speak Liam
Tiberius, can you dispel that shit?
-speak Orion
It's the same spell.
-speak Laura
It's a restoration spell, it's not a dispel.
-speak Marisha
I might be able to.
-speak Orion
So, the guy knocked down over there is-- let me see that pointer.
This guy, that's the one that we knocked out with the arrow?
-speak Taliesin
Yeah, that's the dead one.
-speak Orion
The dead one or the one we knocked out?
-speak Taliesin
He's dead.
-speak Orion
Who do we have incapacitated?
-speak Taliesin
That's the one we shot.
-speak Marisha
That's the one Liam has.
-speak Laura
Let one live.
-speak Orion
And the one right here is.
.
.
?
-speak Liam
The one by me is weak.
-speak Matt
Both of them are pretty weak right now, actually.
-speak Orion
I think I can step next to Percy without stepping into that cloud.
-speak Matt
So you can step over Grog, get around here, you mean?
-speak Laura
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Laura
Honk.
-speak Travis
That's-- come on.
-speak Orion
Sorry, excuse me, Grog, pardon.
I will shoot a firebolt at the butthole across the way.
-speak Matt
There?
All right.
Go ahead and roll for the attack.
-speak Orion
14.
-speak Matt
14.
Unfortunately does not hit.
You aim, and it manages to just pull out of the way.
-speak Laura
Oh my gosh.
-speak Matt
Vex.
You're up.
-speak Laura
Me?
-speak Matt
Yes.
-speak Laura
I step over, and I try to shoot the one that he just-- I stay out of the stink.
-speak Matt
There you go, yeah.
Pull back--
-narrate
(imitates bow shooting arrow)
-speak Laura
All right.
-speak Matt
Roll to attack.
-speak Laura
23.
-speak Matt
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
-speak Laura
Eight.
-speak Matt
That's enough.
As the arrow
-narrate
(imitates arrow flying)
-speak Matt
, careens off, slams into the chest.
-narrate
(groans)
-speak Matt
It catches itself, steps back, and plummets off the side of the cliff onto the lower floor about 20 feet down.
Smack, onto the ground.
-speak Laura
And I ask Scanlan to dispel the stank cloud.
-speak Taliesin
Dispel the stank.
-speak Laura
And I yell-- Can I yell out 
-speak Matt
surrender
-speak Matt
in Undercommon?
-speak Matt
You yell out,
-narrate
(speaks angry gibberish)
-speak Matt
!
-narrate
(Laura speaks angry gibberish)
-speak Matt
Make an intimidation check.
-speak Travis
That was a very good Klingon translation.
-speak Laura
Klingon.
-narrate
(Liam speaks angry gibberish)
-speak Laura
Whoa!
Okay.
Um, eight.
-speak Matt
Eight?
-speak Laura
Eight.
-speak Liam
What is with the dice tonight?
-speak Matt
It rolled a one.
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Matt
It looks around and its circumstances being extremely dire.
It drops its weapons, falls to its knees.
At your mercy.
That's where we'll end the game tonight.
-speak Sam
Oh!
-speak Taliesin
Hey!
-speak Travis
What?
!
-speak Matt
Yeah.
-speak Laura
You're, you're-- yeah.
-speak Sam
Grog is brain dead.
-speak Marisha
I was gonna say, can I go over and heal Grog before we end?
-speak Travis
I'm Vanilla Sky right now.
-speak Matt
Nope, we're picking up next week.
-speak Laura
Oh no.
-speak Liam
Just five more hours, Matt.
Just five more hours.
-speak Matt
We'll say for the circumstance here, you go ahead and spend a healing spell on him.
His wounds mend, no effect on his catatonic state.
-narrate
(group groans)
-speak Sam
We have to wait a week.
-speak Matt
Well guys, that's episode two of Critical Role.
-narrate
(laughs)
-speak Marisha
Damn it.
-speak Matt
I hope you enjoyed it.
Remember to tell your friends to come watch.
We'll be back next week, Thursday at 7:00.
I know the schedule said seven to nine.
We usually run a little later.
Because D&D and why not?
-speak Laura
Oh, is this seven to nine?
-speak Matt
It says seven to nine in the schedule, but we consider seven to ten.
But yeah, hope you guys had fun.
Thank you so much for watching.
Hope we will have our donations up next week.
Feel free to check it out.
This is Zac, our amazing master of all awesomeness on this Twitch channel.
Hey Zac, what's going on?
-speak Zac

-speak Matt
Thank you, thank you.
-speak Zac
You got a thousand subscribers.
-narrate
(group cheers)
-speak Zac
Crazy, that's like, two weeks in.
-speak Matt
Yeah, I know.
You go, Nyal.
We'll get you your stuff.
-speak Marisha
Yeah, you get a Player's Handbook.
That's lucky.
-speak Zac
We'll get you your shit!
I gotta print that photo so you guys can all sign it.
-speak Matt
Yes yes, let's go do that.
-speak Zac
No, it'll probably be sent to you next Friday, 'cause we'll have you guys sign it next Thursday.
-speak Laura
Sounds good.
-speak Matt
Okay, cool.
-speak Travis
Zac, do you have any renew intelligence potions on you, by chance?
-speak Zac
For you?
-speak Travis
Yeah.
-speak Zac
No.
-speak Travis
Shit.
-speak Matt
Sorry buddy.
-speak Zac
So we're not going offline for the night yet.
These guys are gonna head out and Lucas and I are gonna play some Hotline Miami 2.
For an hour, hour and a half.
-speak Matt
There you go, rock it out.
-speak Zac
You know, just to close out the night with a subscriber-only chat to say thank you to our thousand subscribers.
And tomorrow night we will be back with So You Don't Have to, which is a show where Hector and Becca play the weirdest games they can find online, so you don't have to.
-speak Marisha
Nice.
-narrate
(Matt laughs)
-speak Zac
And then we finish off tomorrow night with Gather Your Party, which is just a big party where we're going to be celebrating getting 1,000 subscribers, playing some board games.
We have a band coming in to play.
-speak Matt
Awesome.
-speak Zac
It's gonna be a good time.
We might even have a DJ spinning some-- I don't know.
How do you say it?
Spinning?
-speak Travis
Some tunes.
-speak Matt
Spin tunes.
-speak Travis
Dropping some dope beats.
-speak Orion
On the ones and twos.
Ones and twos.
-speak Zac
So thank you guys again.
Lucas, if you wanna go ahead and roll those videos, and we'll get you guys out
